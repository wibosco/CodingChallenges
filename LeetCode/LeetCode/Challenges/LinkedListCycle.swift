//linked list
struct LinkedListCycle {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list
    //Space: O(1)
    //two pointers
    //slow and fast pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a fast and slow pointer iterate through the list. If they meet we know that we have a cycle; if they don't meet and the
    //fast pointer reaches the end of the list then we don't have a cycle.
