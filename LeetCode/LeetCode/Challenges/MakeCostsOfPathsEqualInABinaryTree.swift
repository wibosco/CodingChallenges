struct MakeCostsOfPathsEqualInABinaryTree {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
    //binary tree
    //DFS
    //recursive
    //bottom-up
    //inout
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //In order to make all paths equal in the tree we need to make all paths equal to the maximum existing path, this means
    //that one path in the tree should not have any increments made to it. In order to get the minimum increments we want
    //to ensure that the maximum increments possible are made at the highest level in the tree as one increment to a node
    //affects both child/subtrees of that node vs individually incrementing each child node i.e. 1 increment vs 2
    //increments. While it's possible to do this top-down, it is actually easier to do it bottom-up by equalising sibling
    //pairs - in order for a change to a parent node to have equal impact on the child/subtree nodes, those child/subtree
    //nodes need to be equal. So by equalising the child nodes to the greater value of those nodes we make the minimum
    //number of changes at that level. This also ensures that the path that doesn't need to change isn't changed. We
    //repeat this process as the recursive stack unwinds until we are back at root.
