struct WordBreak {
    
    //Time: O(n^2) where n is the number of elements in `s`
    //Space: O(n+m) where n is the number of elements in `s`, `m` is the elements in `wordDict`
    //memoization
    //dynamic programming
    //DFS
    //recursive
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS we iterate through `s` attempting to find a match for an element in `wordDict`. Once we find a match we then
    //recursively search for another match from `s[matchEndIndex...]` and we repeat this process until we run out of
    //characters in `s` to search. If immediately before running of character we found a match then we know that we can
    //successfully break `s` up into the elements of `wordDict` - we can determine this by checkung if `startIndex` is outside
    //of `s.count`; if run out of characters without ending on a match then we know that `s` can not be broken up. As it is
    //possible for a sequence of characters to exist in `wordDict` as both a whole element and the prefix of an element e.g.
    //"cat" and "cats" - when searching if a recursive call comes back as false we don't abandon that search space until we
    //have exhausted `s` from that start index by adding more characters on to the word to be searched. To avoid traversing
    //the same branches on the search tree we store the outcome of a particular index in `memo`.
    //
    //N.B. We only store the branches in `memo` that result in a failed attempt to break `s` up. As soon as we find one branch
    //that results in a successful DFS we know that the result can be split up successfully.
    //
    //N.B. Memoization is a term describing an optimization technique where you cache previously computed results, and return
    //the cached result when the same computation is needed again.
    //
    //N.B. Dynamic programming can be thought of as local brute force.
