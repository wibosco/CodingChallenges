    //Solution Description:
    //We can treat the `adjacentPairs` as an edge list and so treat this problem as a graph. First we convert `adjacentPairs`
    //into an adjacency list (`adjList`) to allow for quicker search of neighbors. As we don't know the direction of the pair
    //we need to add both elements in the pair as source and destination of each other. Then we find a root/entry node of the
    //graph which is a node that has an outdegree of 1 - there will be two nodes that satisfy this requirement, we take the
    //first one which means that the second will node will be our end node. Once we find our root node we add it to `array`,
    //we then iterate through the our elements in `adjList` and build up `array` using the previously added elements of
    //`array `as either the key or constraint to finding the next element. Once we've iterated through all elements we can
    //return `array`

        var array = [Int]()
