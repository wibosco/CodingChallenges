    //Time: O(n^2) where `n` is the number of cells in the matrix
    //Space: O(n^2)
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //By squaring `n` we know how many cells the matrix will contain so we can create an empty matrix of that size. We then
    //iterate through that empty matrix filling any empty cells (with a value of `0`) that we encounter with the next matrix
    //value. As we want to iterate in a spiral fashion for the outer cells we can use the matrix boundaries themselves to
    //know when to change direction then as we move from the outer cells to internal cells we can use the cells value to
    //know when to change direction i.e. value > 0 we change. Evntually we will have filled in all the cells in the matrix
    //and can return it
