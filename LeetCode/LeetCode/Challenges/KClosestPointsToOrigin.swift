    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums`
    //Space: O(n + log n) where n is the number of elements in `nums` (log n for the recursive stack)
    //quickselect
    //in-line
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using `quick select` we sort `points` around a pivot by gradually partitioning `nums` into a smallers semi-sorted arrays.
    //We do not need to fully sort `points`, instead we only need to sort up to the `kth` index so after each partitioning we
    //check if the elements up to the `kth` index as been sorted if so we can return `points[0..<k]` else we take one half of
    //the semi-sorted array and partition it further.
    //
    //N.B. Here we are using Lomutos partitioning scheme, see:
    //https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/tree/master/Quicksort#lomutos-partitioning-scheme
