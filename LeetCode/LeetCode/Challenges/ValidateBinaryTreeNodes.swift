struct ValidateBinaryTreeNodes {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(n)
    //binary tree
    //array

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Binary Tree have certain rules:
    //
    // 1. One root node
    // 2. No cycles
    // 3. Non-root nodes have one parent
    // 4. All nodes are connected
    //
    //Using these rules we can determine if we have a binary tree. First we verify rule 1 - to find the root we iterate
    //through all nodes and track which children they have - the root is the node that doesn't appear as a child of another
    //node. If more than one root is returned then we know that this isn't a valid binary tree and can return false. Next
    //using DFS we verify rule 2 and 3, by traversing from the root all connected nodes. we track the nodes that we have
    //visited using a `visited` set - this allows us to detect cycles and multiple parents as we should only visit each
    //node a maximum of once. If we encounter a node twice we return false. Finally we verify rule 4 by ensuring that our
    //DFS visited all nodes by comparing the `visited` count against `n`.
