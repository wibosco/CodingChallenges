    //Time: O(n + m) where n is the numbers of elements in `nums1`, m is the number of elements in `nums2`
    //Space: O(n) where n is the the number of elements in `nums1`
    //monotonic decreasing stack
    //dictionary
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a monotonic decreasing stack we iterate through `nums2` finding the next greater value for each element in that
    //array. We do this by placing each element we come across in the stack - `stack`. We then check if the current element
    //is greater than the last stack item - if it is greater then we have just found the "next greater element" to that last
    //stack element which we can then add to the `greaterThan` dictionary with the lesser element being the key and the
    //greater element the value - this used stack element is popped from the stack so it can't be resused; if the last stack
    //element is greater than the current element then we just add that current element to the stack and continue iterating.
    //By doing this we won't have to iterate through `nums2` when looking for greater elements in the `nums1` loop instead
    //we will just "jump" straight to that "next greater element" (if it exists) in the `greaterThan` dictionary. It's
    //important to note that as `nums1` is a subset of `nums2` we know that the first greater value of a `nums2` element is
    //also the first greater value of that same element in `nums1`. Once we are finished populating `greaterThan` we iterate
    //through `nums1` and populate `result` with the values from `greaterThan` in the order of `nums1`

        var stack = [Int]()
        
        var greaterThan = [Int: Int]()
        for num in nums2 {
            while !stack.isEmpty {
                guard stack.last! < num else {
                    break

    //Space: O(n + m)
    //dictionary
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //First we build up a dictionary of all the values in `nums2` and their location. We then iterate through `nums1` using
    //the `indexing` dictionary to jump straight to the index in `nums2` for the current `nums1` element. From that element
    //we then search for any elements greater than `num1`. If we find an element it becomes an entry in `result` else we add
    //-1
