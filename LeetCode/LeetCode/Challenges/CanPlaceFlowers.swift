    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through the array. For every emput plot we check the previous index (where possible) and the next index (where
    //possible) to see if we can plant on this plot. If possible we plant and increment `placed` by one. At the end of the
    //loop we check if we planted at least `n` flowers
