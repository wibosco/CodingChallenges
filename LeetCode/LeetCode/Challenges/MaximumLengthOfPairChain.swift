    //Solution Description:
    //By sorting by the second element in `pairs` we ensure that the next element is the smallest possible remaining element in
    //`pairs` so allowing us to perform a greedy, linear iteration through pairs and find the longest possible chain. By sorting
    //`pairs` we know that the longest chain must include the first elements so don't need to include multiple sources.
    //
    //N.B. We don't stop the iteration after a failure of `p2[0] > last[1]` as the longest chain can be a non-contiguous slice.

    //valid subsequences of `pairs` has been created and take the maximum size of the created chains as the longest chain which
    //is then returned. As our DFS can result the same we use memoization to cache the maximum chain size we find for each
    //element/node work and so allow us to save on work if a later DFS recursion attempts to find maximum chain size from that
    //same element/node.
