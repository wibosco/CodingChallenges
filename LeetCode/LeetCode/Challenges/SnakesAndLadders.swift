    //Solution Description:
    //Treating `board` as a graph we can perform a BFS in order to determine the fewest moves required in order to each the end of
    //the board. First we flatten the board into 1-dimension array which allow for easier movement around the board by reducing the
    //need to move between rows - it's important to note that the order of the movement alternates between rows and we need to take
    //that into account when flattening the board. Next we perform a level traversal of the graph which each level being considered
    //a "move". As it's possible to move between 1 and 6 positions we check for target within that range. If target hasn't been hit
    //we add that new position to the next iteration of the queue. The `visited` set allows us to cut down on the amount of
    //searching by ensuring we only search from position once (apart from 0). If at the end of the BFS we haven't hit `target` then
    //we return -1.
