    //Space: O(1)
    //array
    //binary search
    //sorted
    //
    //Solution Description
    //We can use binary search to find the leftmost element closest to `x` then return `k` elements from that index.

        var left = 0

    //Space: O(1)
    //array
    //two pointers
    //sliding window
    //sorted
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Keeping a window size of `k` we iterate through `arr` and move that window depending on if the current `arr` element is
    //closer to `x`. We can't just gradually slide the window as `arr` contains duplicates so instead we the current `arr`
    //element is closer we take it as the `right` pointer of the window and subtract `k` from `right` to get the `left` pointer
    //of the window. Once all elements have been processed we return the window.

    //array
    //two pointers
    //binary search
    //sorted
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Splitting this into two problems. First we find the smallest closet element of `arr` to `x` using binary search. We know
    //that the closet element will be in the `k` elements to be returned, now we need to find which other elements to include
    //(if any). We compare the neighbors of the closest element against each using two pointers and "select" the closer to `x`
    //by expanding it's pointer. When we have selected `k` elements, we return elements between `left + 1` and `right + 1`.
