    //Solution Description:
    //1. Using disjoint set build up a set of possible values for any of `s` indexes.
    //   This is needed because the swaps that can occur can interact with each other
    //2. Assign the actual character value to each of those groups
    //3, Sort each group to enusre that the smallest value character is first
    //4. Iterate through `s` changing the character at any given index for the smallest
    //   in the group (for that index)

//Union-by-rank/disjoint set

//Can only be applied on undirected graphs
//
//Solution Description:
//1. Each vertice is given an initial value of -1 to indicate
//   that they are their own root
//2. Perform a union between two vertices by finding the root
//   of each vertice (this will be a negative number). This root
//   may not be directly associated with the vertice but instead
//   require multiple steps hence the while loop in `find`
//3. Compare the size of the nodes assoicated with each vertices
//   root and select the root with the most nodes i.e. lowest
//   negative value. Update the smaller root to point at the other
//   root and update the other roots count to include the count that
//   the former root had
