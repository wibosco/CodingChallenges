struct DeleteLeavesWithAGivenValue {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
    //binary tree
    //DFS
    //recursive
    //bottom-up
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS we traverse to the leaf nodes of each branch and then pass back if the parent node should delete that child. This
    //ensures that if a parent node becomes a leaf node and it's value matches `target` it will also be deleted.
