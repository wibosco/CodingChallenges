struct CourseScheduleII {
    
    //Time: O(n * m) `n` is number of courses and `m` is number of prerequisites
    //Space: O(n * m)
    //BFS
    //multi-source
    //indegree
    //outdegree
    //topological order
    //adjacency list
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using an adjacency list buld up the out going edges for each course to then use during BFS traversal. Also build up a count
    //of the in-degree for each course - in order for a course to be taken, all prerequisite course must have been taken first,
    //the `inDegrees` array will ensure this. As we can have multiple starting courses (courses with no prerequisities i.e
    //in-degree == 0) we add these first to the queue. Using BFS we then traverse the graph adding new courses to the queue when
    //they no longer have any outstanding prerequisities. Each course in the queue is added to the `order` array. Once the queue
    //is empty we check if the `order` arrays count is equal to `numCourses` and if so return that order and if not return any
    //empty array as some courses couldn't be taken - dependency cycle.
    //
    //In graph theory a `*degree` is either the number of incoming (`inDegree`) and outgoing (`outDegree`) edges.
