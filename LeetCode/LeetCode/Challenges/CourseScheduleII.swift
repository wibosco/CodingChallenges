    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Topological sort allow us to order a graphs vertices so that all vertices e.g. `v1`, `v2` and `v3` that have an indegree
    //to `u` are ordered before `u` i.e. [v1, v2, v3, u]. It is useful to think of this as jobs that have dependencies so in
    //the above example `v1`, `v2` and `v3` are dependencies of `u` i.e. for `u` to complete `v1`, `v2` and `v3` need to
    //complete first. Topological sort is only possible on graphs that do not contain cycles i.e. DAGs. As any graph can contain
    //multiple subgraphs we need to visit each vertice in the graph and (potentially) perform a deep-first search from that
    //vertice to all connected vertices. As DFS goes deep before wide, all of vertices connected to vertice e.g. `A` will be
    //searched before the recursive call to `A` returns (think of it like the balanced brackets problem e.g. [A, [B, [C, C], B],
    //A]), we can use this property to detect cycles in our graph - if we find a node has an edge to `A` before `A` has
    //returned then we know that we have a cycle, if however `A` has returned and we find another connection to `A` then all that
    //we have found is another way to get to `A` (and not a cycle). Due to need that we need to detect cycles and also avoid
    //re-searching the same subgraph from different starting vertices we need to track two types of `visited` vertices - vertices
    //who's graph has been searched (`visited`) and vertices who's descendants are still being processed (`currentVisited`), once
    //a vertices descendants have been fully searched we then remove it from `currentVisited`. As the descendants of each vertice
    //is processed we add that vertice to the `ordering` array. Once all vertices have been processed and no cycles found we then
    //reverse `ordering` to get the topological order.
    //
    //N.B. There might a number of ways to produce a valid topological sort of a graph as long as all dependencies are completed
    //first, all those different sorts are valid/correct
    //
    //N.B. The below example is using DFS as seen here:

    //Solution Description:
    //Using an adjacency list build up the out-going edges for each course to then use during BFS traversal. Also build up a count
    //of the in-degree for each course - in order for a course to be taken, all prerequisite course must have been taken first,
    //the `inDegrees` array will ensure this. As we can have multiple starting courses (courses with no prerequisites i.e
    //in-degree == 0) we add these first to the queue. Using BFS we then traverse the graph adding new courses to the queue when
    //they no longer have any outstanding prerequisites. Each course in the queue is added to the `order` array. Once the queue
    //is empty we check if the `order` arrays count is equal to `numCourses` and if so return that order and if not return any
    //empty array as some courses couldn't be taken - dependency cycle.
    //
    //In graph theory a `*degree` is either the number of incoming (`inDegree`) and outgoing (`outDegree`) edges.
