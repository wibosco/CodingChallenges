struct LongestCommonPrefix {
    
    //Time: O(n * m) where n is the number of elements in `strs`

    //string
    //array
    //vertical scanning
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //First we convert our strings to character arrays to allow for easier index accessing. Next we take the first element
    //and iterate through its characters. At each iteration we compare the `c` against the character at the same index in
    //each of the other `chrs`. If that index doesn't exist or the character doesn't match `c` we return the prefix that we
    //have built up so far. If we iterate through all characters in `chrs[0]` and only find matches then we can return `prefix`
    //
    //NB: if we get to the final return it means not only that the whole of `chrs[0]` is the prefix but also that `chrs[0]`
    //must the smallest (or joint smallest) element in `strs`

    //Solution Description:
    //First we convert each `strs` element into a character array to allow for easier index accessing. As we are coverting to
    //character arrays we also find which `strs` element is the shortest as that will be the upper bounds for the prefix. Using
    //that upper bounds we iterate through the elements in `chars` and compare each character at a given index. If any character
    //is different from the rest we abort. If all characters at that index are the same we add that character to `prefix` and
    //repeat the process. If we iterate through all indexes up to the upper bounds and only find matches then we can return
    //`prefix`.
