    //Using binary search we iterate through `arr` and move leftwards or rightwards depending on whether we are on an
    //ascending or descending slope. When `left` crosses `right` then we have found our peak at `left` and can return it.

    //Solution Description:
    //Using binary search we iterate through `arr` and move leftwards or rightwards depending on whether we are on an
    //ascending or descending slope. At each index we compare the value at `mid` against its neighbors to determine if
    //that index a peak. If we find the peak we immediately return it.
    //
    //N.B. Care must be taken to ensure we don't go out of bounds.
