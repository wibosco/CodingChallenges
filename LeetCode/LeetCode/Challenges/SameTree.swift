struct SameTree {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in a matching tree
    //Space: O(h) where h is the number of levels in a matching tree
    //binary tree
    //DFS
    //recursive
    //matching
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS we traverse through both trees at once, checking that each level the nodes have the same value.
