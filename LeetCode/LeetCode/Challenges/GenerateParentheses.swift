struct GenerateParentheses {
    
    //Time: O(2^n) where n is the depth of the tree and 2 is the branches at each level
    //Space: O(n) where n is the number of pairs of parentheses
    //string
    //recursive
    //backtracking
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using backtracking we explore each possible combination of "(" and ")". To avoid having to use extra space by
    //generating an array containing `n` opening brackets and `n` closing brackets we instead use counters for opening
    //and closing can still be added to an existing combination - as will as saving space this approach also allows
    //us to easily determine if a bracket combination is valid but ensuring we never add an unmatched closing bracket.
    //During the combination generation at level we check if we have any remaining brackets to use. If we don't we
    //add `current` to our `combinations` array as `current` will have `n` pairs. If we do we check if we have the
    //opening bracket balance we above 0 and we spend 1 opening bracket, next we check if the closing bracket balance
    //is greater than the opening bracket balance i.e. we need to match up some opening brackets, if it is greater we
    //add a closing bracket; if it isn't we skip over (this happens when the current branch won't result in a valid
    //bracket combination and that branch should be abandoned).
