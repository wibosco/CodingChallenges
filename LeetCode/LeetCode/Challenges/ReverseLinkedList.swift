struct ReverseLinkedList {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list.
    //Space: O(1)
    //linked list
    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using two pointers we iterate through the list and update the `cur` node's next pointer to point to the previous
    //node (or nil if the current node is the head of the list), we then update the `cur` to be the "old" next node `tmp`
    //and repeat the process until all nodes have been visited and updated. `prev` is now the head of the reversed list.
    //The reversal happens like:
    //
    //[1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5]
    //[2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5] [1]
    //[3 -> 4 -> 5] [2 -> 1]
    //[4 -> 5] [3 -> 2 -> 1]
    //[5] [4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1]
    //[5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1]
    //
    //As you can see as we swap nodes, we are effectively move them from one list to another

    //recursive
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Recursively iterate through the list, shrinking the list by one with each call until we get to the tail (base case) i.e.
    //node with no `next`. We return the tail back up the call stack. With each return we take the head at that level and
    //reverse the pointer relationship with its next node i.e. from `head -> next` to `next -> head` (remembering to set the
    //next of head to nil to avoid introducing a cycle). We continue this until all nodes in the list have been swapped.

        return reversedHead // this is the same node that is passed through all the recursive calls -
                            //it's the new head/former tail from the base case

    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list.
    //Space: O(1)
    //linked list
    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through the list until we find the tail. Once we have the tail start to move the nodes one at time from the
    //front of the list to be directly behind the old tail.

    //through the array in reverse order in pairs, swapping the order of the pair around and reattaching the swap nodes
    //with the surrounding nodes.
