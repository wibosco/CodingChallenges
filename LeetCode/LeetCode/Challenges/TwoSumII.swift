    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums`

    //two pointers
    //sorted
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //As `numbers` is sorted we can use two pointers at either end to iterate through the array to find `target`. If the
    //elements at `left` and `right` sum to `target` then we are done and can return those indexes; if the elements at
    //`left` and `right` sum to greater than `target` then we need to reduce the sum value at `right` by moving inwards by
    //1 (remember `numbers` is sorted so moving the `left` pointer inwards would only increase how over `target` we are so
    //our only option is moving the `right` pointer); if the elements at `left` and `right` sum to less than `target` then
    //we need to increase the sum value which we can do by moving the `left` pointer inwards (remember `numbers` is sorted
    //so moving the `right` pointer inwards would only reduce the sum value (which is already too low) so our only option
    //is moving the `left` pointer)

            let sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            
            if sum == target {
                return [(left + 1), (right + 1)]

                right -= 1

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //As `numbers` is sorted, we use its sortedness to speed up searching for partner to the present `nums` element by using
    //binary search to half the search space after each mismatch. With each iteration through `nums` we can further reduce
    //the search space as only `nums` elements after the current element could be valid partners so the `left` boundary of
    //our binary search will gradually creep forward.

            //only search indexes in front of i as if a previous index was its partner then we would have found
            //the current `i` during that previous `i`s iteration

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through `nums` and add every other `nums` element after it to check if the sum equals `target`. As `nums` is sorted
    //once we encounter elements that are greater than the difference between `target` - current `nums` element then we can exit
    //that iteration as no further `nums` elements will allow us to reach `target`
