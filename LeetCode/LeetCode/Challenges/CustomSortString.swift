    //Solution Description:
    //We build a dictionary containing the count of each character in `s`. We then go through the characters of `order` and
    //when a character of `order` appears in `freq` we add it n-times to our ordered array `orderedS`. Finally any
    //characters that appear in `s` but not in `order` are appended to the end of `orderedS` the number of times they
    //appear.

    //Solution Description:
    //We build a dictionary containing the count of each character in `order`. We build up two arrays of character when iterating
    //through `s`, if the character appears in `order` we determine where it should go in relation to characters already added to
    //`orderedS` an insert it. If it doesn't then we append it to `others`. Finally we concatenate `orderedS` and `others` to get
    //the final string ordering
