    //characters that appear in `s` but not in `order` are apended to the end of `orderedS` (careful to add them the
    //number of times they apeear in `s`).

    //`orderedS` an insert it. If it doesn't then we append it to `others`. Finally we concatenate `orderedS` and `others` to get
    //the final string ordering
