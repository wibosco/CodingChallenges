    //Solution Description:
    //An `O` element is only "safe" if it either on the edge of the board or connected to a squence of `O` elements that
    //eventually are on the edge of the board. So rather than checking each `O` element on the board instead we only
    //need to check those that are on the edge of the board and find all other `O` elements connected to that one. So
    //using DFS we search the first and last elements on each row (left and right edge) and when we encounter a `O`
    //element we update it to be `S` to mark it as staying an `O`. Setting the `O` element to `S` has the effect of
    //marking this index as visited. Using relative indexing we then search that elements neighbours for other `O`
    //elements. We then perform the same search for the first and last element of each column (top and bottom edge).
    //Once we've search for `O` elements from all edges we then iterate through all elements on the board and when we
    //encounter an `S` we transform it into `O`, if we encounter an `X` or `O` we set it to `X`.

    //indexes we add each index we search to the `visited` set. Finally we iterate through all the elements in the board
