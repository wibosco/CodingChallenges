    //Space: O(n - d) where `n` is the number of characters in `s` and `d` are number of duplicates
    //stack
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through `s` inspecting each character to see if it matches the last element in `stack`. If it does match we
    //remove that last element from the stack and skip over the current character. If it doesn't match we add the character
    //to the stack. Once we have iterated through all characters in `s` we return what is still in the stack as the result.

    //two pointers

    //Solution Description:
    //Using two pointers we iterate through `s` comparing each character with it's immediate right most character. If they
    //match we remove both characters, if they don't match we move on. Finally what is left is the result.
