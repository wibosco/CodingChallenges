    //to all nodes in set B but must connect to at least one node). Treating the index of the elements in `graph` as a node

    //we "color" each level of nodes by placing that node in a dictionary (`nodes`) with the node being the key and the
    //"color" being the value. As we iterate through each level of nodes we alternate the "color" for that level. If we
    //encounter a node that already exists in `nodes` and isn't that levels color i.e. matches the "parent" nodes color
    //then we know that this graph is bipartite and can return false. We repeat this process of "coloring" for each node as
    //it possible for that this graph contains unconnected nodes/subgraphs.
