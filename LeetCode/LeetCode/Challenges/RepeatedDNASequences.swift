struct RepeatedDNASequences {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is number of elements in `s`
    //Space: O(n) where n is the number of elements in `s`
    //array
    //dictionary
    //sliding window
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a sliding window approach we set the window size (10 characters - 0...9) and move through `s` storing each
    //10 character sequence that we come across in a set. If the set already contains the current sequence then we know
    //that we have a repeat and can add it to the `repeatedSequences` set. Each iteration through the loop we increment
    //the left and right index to keep the same window size and ensure that we are moving forward.
