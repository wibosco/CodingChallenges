struct DiameterOfNAryTree { //DiameterOfN-AryTree
    
    //Time: O(n log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(c) where `c` is the number of nodes at any level
    //DFS
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Remembering that a tree is made up of smaller trees we use DFS to traverse to the end of each branch of those trees.
    //We are only interested in the two deepest branches in each subtree. We then compare the diameter of those deepest
    //branches with the current deepest diameter to determine if we have a new deepest. Particular attention has to be paid
    //to if a subtree only contains one initial node, as this is still a valid path and we shouldn't discard its subtree by
    //insisting on each subtree having at least two children i.e.
    //                  1
    //                  2
    //                3   4
    //              5   6
    //If we insisted on each subtree needing to have two children we would never get down to [3, 4, 5, 6] where the longest
    //diameter is to be found eventually we get back to the root where we stop.
