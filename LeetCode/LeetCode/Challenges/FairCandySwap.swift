struct FairCandySwap {
    
    //Time: O(n + m) where n is the number of elements in `aliceSizes`
    //               where m is the number of elmets in `bobSizes`
    //Space: O(n)
    //array
    //set
    //maths
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //First we determine the total of `aliceSizes` and `bobSizes` so that we can calculate the difference/delta between the two
    //arrays - this delta will be used to offset how many candies to transfer back to Bob after bob has transfered some to Alice.
    //Then we iterate through `bobSizes` and transfer one over to Alice (we don't actually do anything here), next we calculate
    //how many candies Alice would need to transfer to Bob to even out their totals. To speed up knowing it Alice has an
    //element with that value we have convert `aliceSizes` into a set to allow fo O(1) lookup time. If `aliceSizeLookup` has an
    //element of that value we return both size else we iterate again.
    //
    //N.B. by calculating `candyDifference` without using `abs` we can end up with a negative which means that we dont have to
    //care about who has the larger total when attempting the transfer. As transfering first from the smaller array just means we
    //have to transfer more back while transfering from the smaller array means we have to transfer less back. But both transfers
    //just work without an special handling.

        var bobTotal = 0
