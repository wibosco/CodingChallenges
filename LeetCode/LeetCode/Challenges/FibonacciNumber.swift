    //recursive
    //DFS
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a top-down approach calculate the value for each `n` and add them together. This value is then stored so that there
    //is no need to re-calculate (and so prevent the same recursive stack being built multiple times e.g. notice how
    //`8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0` contains `5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0` so there than recalculating `5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0` we just store it away
    //as the value we get for a fib sequence of `5` and if we need get the fib sequence of `5` we returned it directly from
    //that store.
    //
    //N.B. Memoization is a term describing an optimization technique where you cache previously computed results, and return
    //the cached result when the same computation is needed again.
    //
    //N.B. Dynamic programming can be thought of as local brute force.
