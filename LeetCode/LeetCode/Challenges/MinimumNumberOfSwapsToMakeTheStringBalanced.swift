    //stack
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Moving linearly through `s` we add each mismatched bracket to the stack. Where we come across a closing bracket we
    //check if the last element in the stack is an opening bracket. If it is we remove it from the stack as it isn't
    //mismatched; if it isn't we add it to the stack. Once we have reached the end of `s` our stack will contain all the
    //mismatched brackets - both `[` and `]`. In order to match a pair of brackets we only need to move one bracket so we
    //can half the stack count. Dor every swap we solve not one but two mismatched brackets so we again divide the count
    //by 2. We add 1 to ensure that we et the correct answer for both odd and even counts.

    //Solution Description:
    //Moving linearly through `s` track any mismatched (without an opening bracket) closing bracket we encounter as these
    //will need to be swapped with a mismatched opening bracket inorder for `s` to be balanced - as `s` is guaranteed to
    //have the same number of `[` as `]`, we can't just track the mismatched `]` as this will also reduce down to 0 instead
    //we need to track what it was at it's maximum. Once we know the maximum we know that for every swap we solve not one
    //but two mismatched brackets so we divide the max by 2. We add 1 to ensure that we get the correct answer for both odd
    //and even maxes.
