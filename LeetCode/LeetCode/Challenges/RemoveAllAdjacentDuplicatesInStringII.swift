    //counting
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //As we iterate through `s` we store the characters that we come across in `stack` alongside their duplicate count
    //value. We need to store the duplicate count value in the stack as it is possible that when we start removing/popping
    //duplicates from the stack characters that are the same but not directly beside each other in `s` will come together.
    //By storing the duplicate value in the stack we make it possible to determine if that coming-together has resulted in
    //`k` duplicates now being side-by-side without having to recount the stack for the current `s` value. Once we encounter
    //a `duplicateCount` value that matches `k` we pop those duplicates off the stack.

            } else {
                duplicateCount = 1 //new character, reset count
            }
            
            if duplicateCount == k {
                stack.removeLast((k - 1)) //final duplicate wasn't added to the stack so we need to take one away from `k`
            } else {
                //no need to remove the previous count as this would just make converting into a string harder by requiring
                //as to expand on each stack element so that it matches the number of characters matches the count
                stack.append((c, duplicateCount))

    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //As we iterate through `s` we store the characters that we come across in `stack`. If the top of the stack is the same as
    //the current value of `s` we iterate through the stack to see if there are enough duplicates to justify removing those
    //duplicates from the stack. If there are enough duplicates we remove them; if there are not enough duplicates we add the
    //current value to the stack. Once all characters have been processed we return those characters still in the stack.

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a `counts` array we keep track of the duplicate count for the character in `s` that is at the `counts` index.
    //When a `counts` value equals `k` we remove the duplicate characters in `s` until `k` duplicates are gone, we also
    //remove `k` elements from `counts` to keep them in sync. We repeat this process until all of `s` is processed.
    //Special must be taken to reset `i` back to a value before `k` elements where removed.
