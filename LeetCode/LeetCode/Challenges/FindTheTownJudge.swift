struct FindTheTownJudge {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of elements in `trust`
    //Space: O(m) where m is the number of townfolk (n)
    //array
    //indegree
    //outdegree
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Treat this as a graph problem with the `trust` array representing the edges between two vertices. A judge is someone who has
    //`n - 1` indegree connections and 0 outdegree conections. We first create in intial array to represent all the townfolk, with
    //the index being the identifier of that person and the value being difference between indegree and outdegree conections i.e.
    //add 1 for each indegree connection and remove 1 for each outdegree connection. Once all edges have been processed we then
    //iterate through the `townFolk` and check if an element has a value of `n - 1` i.e. trust by all but trusting no one. If there
    //is such an element we have our judge; if not the town doesn't have a judge.
    //
    //In graph theory a `*degree` is either the number of incoming (`inDegree`) and outgoing (`outDegree`) edges
