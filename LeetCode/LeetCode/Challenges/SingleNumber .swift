    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`
    //Space: O(1)
    //bit manipulation
    //bitwise
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterating through `nums` we combine the current element using XOR to find the unpair element - treating each number as its
    //binary representation. This works because the paired elements will cancel each other out so as `result` is XOR'd with the
    //current num the binary bits that match between `num` and `result` are set to 0 and those that don't are set to 1 so with
    //each iteration we gradually get "nearer" to that unparied value.
    //
    //N.B. In an XOR operation the order isn't important - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate

    static func singleNumber(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {
        var result = 0 // n ^ 0 = n so 0 is a safew first value

            result ^= num //XOR

    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`
    //Space: O(n)
    //set
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a set (for O(1) search time) to store `nums` elements that we have already seen, we loop through `nums` and check
    //if that element is already in `singles`. If it is we know it can't be the single and can remove it from the `singles`; if
    //it is not then we add it to `singles` and conintue looping
