struct RemoveKDigits {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of characters in `num`
    //Space: O(n)
    //array
    //string
    //stack
    //monotonic decreasing stack
    //greedy
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //We iterate through `num` and add the elements that we encounter to `stack`. Using a greedy approach if `n` is less than
    //the last element added to the stack and we have remaining removals, we pop that last element - we repeat this process
    //until either the stack is empty, we can't remove any more of we encounter a value on the stack which is equal to or less
    //than `n`. We repeat this process until all elements in `num` have been processed. We then do some house keeping and
    //convert the remaining elements in the stack into a string to be returned.
    //
    //Background:
    //Monotonic = It is a word for mathematics functions. A function y = f(x) is monotonically increasing or decreasing when it
    //follows the below conditions:
    //
    //As x increases, y also increases always, then it’s a monotonically increasing function.
    //As x increases, y decreases always, then it’s a monotonically decreasing function.
    //
