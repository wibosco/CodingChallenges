    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list
    //Space: O(1)
    //linked list
    //two pointers
    //sentinel head
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using two offset pointers we iterate through the list keeping a distance of `n + 1` so that by the time the first pointer (`p1`)
    //reaches the end of list the second pointer (`p2`) is at the `nth - 1` node. We then set the `nth - 1` nodes `next` property to
    //point to the `nth + 1` node so removing the `nth` node from list. Special care needs to be taken if the `nth` node is the `head`
    //node to overcome we introduce a dummy node that we will place before `head` so we can still remove `head` if we need to without
    //introducing any complex logic.

    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list

    //linked list
    //2 passes
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterating through the list we first count how many nodes are in the list and determine what the `nth` node would be. We then
    //iterate back through the list until we get the to the `nth - 1` node and then assign that `next` property of that node to the
    //`nth + 1` node so removing the `nth` node from list.

    //array
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through the list storing each node in an array (in the order we encounter them in). Next work out which index in `nodes`
    //is `Nth from end` and repoint the node `Nth - 1` to point to the `Nth + 1` node. Special care needs to be taken if the `Nth from
    //end` node is the head - in which case we don't need to repoint and can just return `head.next` as the new list head.
