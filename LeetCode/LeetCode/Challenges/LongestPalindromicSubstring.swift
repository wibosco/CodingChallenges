struct LongestPalindromicSubstring {
    
    //Time: O(n^2) where n is the number of characters in `s`
    //Space: O(n)
    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //It's important to note that we are checking for the longest palindrome in this string and not just that this string is
    //palindrome. This means that a palindrome might be from 0..2 or 9..15 or anything in between so when searching a
    //palindrome we need to do so from all indexes. Palindromes come in two flavours: odd and even i.e. "aba" or "aa" which we
    //also need to cater for. Rather than checking if a string is a palindrome by going outside-in we are going to instead go
    //inside-out - this will allow us to count only valid palindromes rather than thinking that we have a palindrome only to
    //discover as we ggget deeper into the substring that it isn't actually a palindrome. Now going inside-out does not mean
    //that we need to start at the center of `s`, inside we start at the start of `s` and gradually move that starting position
    //right. Within each starting position we then attempt to expand out two characters at a time (one character left and one
    //character right), checking we still have characters in `s` to check and that if we do those new characters still form a
    //palindrome - it's important to note here that we only need to check those new characters and not the whole substring
    //again as that substring has already been shown to be a palindrome. With each new palindrome that we encounter we
    //increment `palindromes`. Once we have check each starting position we return the count.
    //
    //N.B. `a` is considered a palindrome so the below solution accounts for that.
    //
