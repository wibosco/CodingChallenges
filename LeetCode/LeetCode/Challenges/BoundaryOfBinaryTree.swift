struct BoundaryOfBinaryTree {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodoes in the tree
    //Space: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
    //binary tree
    //DFS
    //recursive
    //top-down
    //bottom-up
    //inout
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS we first build up the left boundary (and any leaf nodes that fall on that side) by searching the left subtree
    //of root. It important to note that while left child nodes are favoured when building the left boundary, right child
    //nodes can form part of it if there is no left child node so as we traverse we need to be checking for that scenario.
    //To get the ordering we want we add any boundary nodes we encounter to `boundary` before going deeper - top-down. Once
    //the left boundary has been built we switch over to building the right boundary - it's very similar to how we built the
    //left boundary but with `findRightBoundary` set to true this time. To get the ordering we want we add any bounday nodes
    //we encounter to `boundary` as the recursive calls unwind which will order that boundary bottom-up. With both
    //traversals if we encounter a leaf node we add it immediately to `boundary` without checking if it is part of the left
    //or right boundary. Once the left, right and leaf boundaries have been built we add in the root node and return the
    //combined array.
