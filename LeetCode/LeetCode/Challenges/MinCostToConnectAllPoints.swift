    //First, calculate all possible edges between all points in the graph. The first vertice is then added to the visited set as
    //a special case - it could have been any vertice in the graph. As this approach uses Prim's algorithm the adjacent vertices
    //of the visited vertice are added to a min heap. A min heap is used to ensure that we always select the min edge ("cheapest")
    //between unconnected vertices. As we are building a tree we know that we will need to add n - 1 edges where `n` is the number
    //of vertices in the graph - this is what we use for the condition on the while loop. As we inspect the min edge we need to
    //ensure that using it will not create a cycle in the graph by inspecting the `visited` set. If the min edge isn't introducing
    //a cycle we add it's weight to the `total`, add it to the `visited` set and add it's edges to the min heap causes it the
    //potentially reconfig itself.

//Solution Description:
//1. Each vertice is given an initial value of -1 to indicate that they are their own root
//2. Perform a union between two vertices by finding the root of each vertice (this will be a negative number). This root may not
//   be directly associated with the vertice but instead require multiple steps hence the while loop in `find`
//3. Compare the size of the nodes assoicated with each vertices root and select the root with the most nodes i.e. lowest negative
//   value. Update the smaller root to point at the other root and update the other roots count to include the count that the
//   former root had
