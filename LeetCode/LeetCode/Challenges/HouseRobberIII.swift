    //dynamic programming
    //bottom-up
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS to traverse to the bottom of the tree we calculate two possible outcomes for each node - what is the value
    //returned if I rob this node and what is the value returned if I don't rob this node. As we unwind our recursive stack
    //we return those two outcomes for each node. It's important to note that this problem as the constraint of if I rob the
    //current node I can not rob the child node, so when we calculate the outcome for the robbing the current node we can
    //only do so using the "non-robbed" childs value however if we don't rob the current node we are free to choose to rob
    //the child node or not (it might be more valuable to skip multiple nodes). When eventually we get to the top of the
    //tree we return the maximum of either branch.

    //maximum value of whether we should rob the current node or node until we arrive back at the root, at which point
    //we have the maximum and can return it.
