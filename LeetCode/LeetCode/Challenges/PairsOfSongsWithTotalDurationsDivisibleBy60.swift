struct PairsOfSongsWithTotalDurationsDivisibleBy60 {
    
    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the number of elements in `time`
    //Space: O(1) remainders will contain a maximum of 60 entries
    //dictionary
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Store the remainder of each `time % 60` in a dictionary as the key and how many times have that remainder as the value.
    //This allows O(1) access time when checking if that remainder exists when attempting to find a pair for a future song.
    //The trick here is that when attempting to find that pair we need to not search for the remainder directly but rather
    //search for the difference between 60 and that remainder because that difference is what we need to fulfill the
    //requirement that paired songs need to be "(i + j) % 60 == 0"
    //
    //Similar to: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
