struct PairsOfSongsWithTotalDurationsDivisibleBy60 {
    
    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the number of elements in `time`
    //Space: O(1) reminders will contain a maximum of 60 entries
    //dictionary
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Store the reminder of each `time % 60` in a dictionary as the key and how many times have that reminder as the value. This allows
    //O(1) access time when checking if that reminder exists when attempting to find a pair for a future song. The trick here is that
    //when attempting to find that pair we need to not search for the reminder directly but rather search for the difference between
    //60 and that reminder because that difference is what we need to fulfill the requirement that paired songs need to be
    //"(i + j) % 60 == 0"
    //
    //Similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
