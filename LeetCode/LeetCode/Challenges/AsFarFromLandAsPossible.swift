    //Solution Description:
    //Rather than starting with water and attempting to find land, we can flip the problem and instead start with land. Starting
    //with land will allow us to build in previous iterations of our BFS and so only perform one BFS (starting with water means
    //we need to perform a full BFS for each water square/element). As we are performing a BFS we know that any square previously
    //unsearched square we encountered is shortest/minimum path we could have taken from land to get there. First we add all
    //land squares to `queue` and `visited`. We then check for edge cases of no water and no land - if either are true we return
    //-1. Next we perform the BFS using relative indexing to determine where we can move to. By using a level-by-level BFS
    //traversal we are to keep track of how far the squares of water are from land - each level is one more removed from land.
    //To avoid re-searching already searched squares we add each square we encountered to the `visited` set. At the end of the
    //BFS we return `distance`.
    //
    //N.B Manhattan distance (|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|) is the distance between two squares as measured in vertical and/or
    //horizontal moves.
