struct RemoveDuplicatesFromAnUnsortedLinkedList {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list
    //Space: O(n)
    //linked list
    //dictionary
    //frequency
    //two passes
    //sentinel head
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //We iterate through the nodes in the list and populate a frequency dictionary with how many times each `val` appears. We
    //then iterate through the nodes in the list again and where that `val` has a value of 2 or more we skip over that node.
    //In order to skip the node `n` we need to track the node `n-1` which we do with `prev`. Special care needs to be given to
    //when we update `prev` - when we skip a node `prev` does not need to be changed; when we don't skip a node `prev` is set
    //to the `current` node. We make use of a sentinel head in case the first node in the list is duplicate.

                prev.next = c.next
                //no need to update prev as the current prev is now right for the next iteration
