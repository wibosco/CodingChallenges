    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS we traverse the tree and set the `next` property for each node's child nodes we encounter. To conenct
    //subtrees we use the `next` property of the current node to get to it's `next` nodes child nodes.

    //Solution Description:
    //Using BFS we traverse the tree level-by-level. At each level we track the previous (left) node for the current
    //node and then set the `next` property on the `prev` node to the current node. We repeat this process for each
    //node in each level until all nodes have been processed. We then return `root`.
