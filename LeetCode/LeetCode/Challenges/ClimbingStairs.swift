    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Treating climbing stairs as a tree e.g.
    //
    //                0
    //       1                 2
    //   1      2          1       2
    // 1   2  1   2      1   2   1   2
    //
    //You end up with paths in different order e.g. 1 -> 2 -> 1 and 2 -> 1 -> 1. At the end of both these paths you have a
    //total of 4, subsequently all paths from this 4 will result in the same outcome regardless if we got to 4 via
    //`1 -> 2 -> 1` or `2 -> 1 -> 1` (or any other path). With this in mind we only need to go down the 4 path once and then
    //any other path that leads to 4 can reuse that work - shortcutting to the answer and reducing the number of recursive
    //calls. To do this we need to use memooization to store the total number of successful paths from 4 - `memo`. As each
    //path returns we eventually get back to 0 which holds the number of valid climbs.
    //
    //N.B. this is a twist on https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/
