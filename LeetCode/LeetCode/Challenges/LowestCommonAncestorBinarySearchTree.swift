    //Time: O(h) where h is the height of the tree

    //binary tree
    //binary search tree
    //iterative
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using an iterative approach we traverse the tree. At each node we compare the `val` of `node` against that of `p` and `q`;
    //if the `node` value is greater than both then continue search down left branch only; if the root value is less than both
    //then continue search down the right branch only; if the both are different then we have found the lowest common ancestor
    //as one of p and q is in the left branch and one in the right branch or one is in fact the node itself.
    //
    //N.B. As we are able to make informed choices due the nature of a BST we only need to hold onto one node at any given time.

    //Solution Description:
    //Using BFS traverse the tree. Compare the `val` of `root` against that of `p` and `q`; if the root value is greater than both
