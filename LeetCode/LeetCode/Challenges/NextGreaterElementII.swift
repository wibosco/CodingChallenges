    //Space: O(n)
    //stack
    //monotonic stack
    //array
    //two passes
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a decreasing monotonic stack we make two reverse order passes through `nums`. Due the circular nature of `nums` an
    //elements next greater value can be to the right or left of that element so the first pass finds any the greater element
    //that exists to the right and the second pass any greater element that exists to the left. Using a decreasing monotonic
    //stack ensures that the first value found on the stack we the smallest next value that is greater than the current value.
    //We use a `result` array to store the values of the next greater element and return it after the second pass is complete.
    //
