    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree

    //Solution Description:
    //A sorted array produced from a BST has been produced using an inorder traversal. As this tree should have the same(ish)
    //height on both the left and right branches we can assume that the root of the tree is in the middle of the `nums` elements.
    //Using this information we can repeatedly divide our `nums`, creating new roots at each step and recursively joining their
    //left and right nodes until there are no more nodes to be created.
    static func sortedArrayToBST(_ nums: [Int]) -> TreeNode? {
        guard !nums.isEmpty else {
            return nil
        }
        
        let mid = nums.count / 2
        
        let node = TreeNode(nums[mid])
        
        node.left = sortedArrayToBST(Array(nums[0..<mid])) //effectively mid - 1
        node.right = sortedArrayToBST(Array(nums[(mid + 1)..<nums.count]))
        
        return node
    }
