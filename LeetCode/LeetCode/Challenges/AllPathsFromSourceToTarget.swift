    //Solution Description:
    //Using BFS traverse through the graph. As we want to find all paths to the target (rather than just the shortest), the queue
    //used contains not just the node to visit but also the path that lead to that point. If the dequeued node is the target, add
    //the path that got us here to the `paths` array and contine until the queue is empty i.e. all nodes have been visited.

    //Solution Description:
    //Perform a recusive DFS search through the graph, keeping track of the current path. If we find the target then that `path`
    //is added to the `paths` array. As we move back up the recusive call stack we remove the current node from the `path` array.
