    //Solution description:
    //Traverse the tree using DFS. In order for a node to be a common ancestor it needs 2 of the 3 below to be true:
    //
    //1. be either be `p` or `q` itself
    //2. contain `p` in it's right or left branches
    //3. contain `q` in it's right or left branch
    //
    //As we are only interested in the lowest-common-ancestor rather than any common ancestor we need to ensure that we
    //pass back the first node that is true for 2 of the above 3 scenarios. When we find this node we set it to `lca`.
