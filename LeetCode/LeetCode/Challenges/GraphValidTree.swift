    //Solution Description:
    //A valid tree has one root (all nodes need to be connected) and no cycles. First a check is made to ensure that edges are
    //not too few or too many. Then we converted the edges into an adjacency list - this will allow us to know all the out going
    //edges for any given node. As this is an undirected graph, we add `A -> B` and `B -> A` into the adjacency list. We need to
    //do this as we are not given the (potential) root node of our tree so we may need to travel up and as well as down. Next
    //using DFS we traverse the adjacency list. To detect loops in graph we store each node we encounter in the `visited` set -
    //if we encounter a node that we have already visited then we know we have a loop and this graph can not be a valid tree.
    //The exception to this rule is if we encounter a "simple/trivial" loop e.g. `A -> B` and `B -> A` - this is a loop in our
    //graph but as explained a needed path as we don't know which node is the root. To avoid treating this simple loop and a
    //loop we need to treat `A -> B` and `B -> A` as the same path, to do this we store each path we encounter in the `paths`
    //dictionary, with the source node as the key and the destination as an element in a set (value). We then if `node` already
    //exists in `paths` and if `neighbor` is already in the value set. If `neighbor` is in the value set then we can skip this
    //path; if `neighbor` isn't then this in an untraversed path and we check if `neighbor` already exists in `paths` (as a key)
    //If `neighbor` exists as a key in `paths` then we know that we can already visited this node and that this graph has a
    //"complex" loop so can't be a tree. If we run through all edges from a given node and haven't detected a loop we then just
    //need to check if we actually visited each node in the graph. We haven't visited each node then it means that there are
    //isolated nodes in the graph so this graph isn't a tree
    //
    //
    //N.B. In the BFS solution we use a `visited` set and a `paths` set (with sets inside) we could have taken this approach
    //here (or the BFS could have taken this approach) however by using the `paths` dictionary we are able to consolidate both
    //`visited` and `paths` sets into the one data structure. If the "parent" node already exists in the visited `paths`
    //dictionary we check if it has `neighbor` i.e. in the past have we travelled `node -> neighbor` and are now trying to
    //travel `neighbor -> node`. If `neighbor` exists in the set of `node` then we skip, if not we check if `neighbor` exists
    //as a key in `paths`. If `neighbor` is a key, we have a loop.

//Can only be applied on undirected graphs
//
//Solution Description:
//1. Each vertice is given an initial value of -1 to indicate that they are their own root
//2. Perform a union between two vertices by finding the root of each vertice (this will be a negative number). This root may
//   not be directly associated with the vertice but instead require multiple steps hence the while loop in `find`
//3. Compare the size of the nodes associated with each vertices root and select the root with the most nodes i.e. lowest
//   negative value. Update the smaller root to point at the other root and update the other roots count to include the count
//   that the former root had
