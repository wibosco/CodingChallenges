struct BinaryTreeLongestConsecutiveSequence {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(h) where h is the height of the tree
    //binary tree
    //DFS
    //recursive
    //top-down
    //inout
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS we go top-down to find the longest sequence. At each level of the tree we comapre the current node against
    //it's parent node to determine if the child node is continuation of the previous sequence or the start of a new
    //sequence. When we reach the end of a sequence we compare it's length against `longest` and update if necessary. Once
    //all nodes have been checked we return `longest`.
