struct CuttingRibbons {
    
    //Time: O(log n) where `n` is the number of elements in `ribbons`
    //Space: O(1)
    //array
    //maximum
    //divide and conquer
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //The minimum length a ribbbon can be 1 and the maximum length is the maximum  length in `ribbbons`. We can treat
    //this min..max range as a sorted list of possible lengths. Performing a binary search on this range we can find
    //that minimum legnth while discarding half of the possible lengths at each step. If the total ribbon for a given
    //length is equal or greater than `k` then we know that we are potentally cutting the ribbons too short and need
    //to increase the length of each cut i.e. the left edge needs to move right; if the total ribbons are less than
    //`k` then we know that we are cutting each ribbon too long and need to shorten the cut i.e. the right edge needs
    //to move left. Once the right edge is smaller or equal than the left edge, then we should have found the maximum
    //length (if it exists) and can return `right` as that value
    //
    //This is similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/
