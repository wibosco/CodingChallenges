struct LowestCommonAncestorBinaryTreeIII {
    
    //Time: O(n * m) where `n` is the level of `p` and `m` is the level of `q`
    //Space: O(1)
    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Treating this tree as a linked list we can race the two pointers to find the root by moving through child -> parent
    //levels. As `p` and `q` can begin at different levels in the tree, simply waiting for `p` and `q` to meet will not
    //guarantee that the lowest common ancestor is where they meet e.g. if `p` starts at level 8 and `q` starts at level
    //4 then this approach will result in the ancestor being declared as the root when it may be level 3. To overcome this
    //limitation, we need a way to overcome any difference in levels - we can do this with two pointers. First we start both
    //pointers at the levels for `p` and `q` we then navigate up the tree until one of the pointers hits the root at which
    //we reset it to the starting position of the slower pointer, we continue to process the ndoes until the other pointer
    //also hits root at which point it is reset to the quicker pointers starting position. Both pointers will now be at the
    //same level as the difference will of the extra levels the slower needs to traverse will have been eaten up by switching
    //the fast pointer to the slower starting position. When they meet we can guarantee that node will be the lowest common
    //ancestor.

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //First we need to find the root node for this root. Once we have that root node we traverse the tree using DFS. In order
    //for a node to be a common ancestor it needs 2 of the 3 below to be true:
    //
    //1. be either be `p` or `q` itself
    //2. contain `p` in it's right or left branches
    //3. contain `q` in it's right or left branch
    //
    //As we are only interested in the lowest common ancestor rather than any common ancestor we need to ensure that we pass
    //back the first node that is true for 2 of the above 3 scenarios. When we find this node we set it to `lca`
