    //Solution Description:
    //First we need to find the pivot index. To do this we can perform an altered binary search that rather than attempting to
    //find a target is attempting to find where the current index is greater than the next index e.g. [4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2 ,3] -
    //here the pivot is index 3 as index 2 is greater. Once we find the pivot i.e. the original start of the sorted array, we
    //need to determine if the target is before or after that pivot (provided the pivot isn't actually the target) e.g. in
    //[4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2 ,3] is the target in [4, 5, 6] or [1, 2, 3] - effectively performing a one step binary search. Once we
    //have our sorted subarray we can then perform a standard binary search to find the target

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //In a sorted array, index 0 contains a smaller value than index n. We can use this property to know where to search in this
    //array using binary search by treating it as effectively two sorted arrays - 0..<pivot and pivot..n. First we determine our
    //mid point and compare it against the target - if mid is the target then we return that index else we compare mid with our
    //right most index (remember if this is the second or later iterations right wouldn't be nums.count - 1). If mid is greater
    //than right then we know that pivot is in right part of the subarray i.e. right part isn't sorted, so we compare the target
    //against the sorted left array and adjust boundaries appropriately - reducing the search space by half; if mid is less then
    //we do the opposite. Eventually we either find the target in the array or after we have exhausted the search space we return
    //-1
