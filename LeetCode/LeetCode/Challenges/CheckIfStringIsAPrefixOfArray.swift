struct CheckIfStringIsAPrefixOfArray {
    
    //Time: O(n * m) where n is the numbers of elements in `words`
    //               where m is the number of characters in a word
    //Space: O(p) where p in the number of characters in `s`
    //array
    //string
    //three pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using three pointers we iterate through all elements in `words` and compare is element against `s`. The first pointers `p1`
    //and `p2` iterate through `s` and `words` respectively with `p3` iterates through the current element of `words` being checked.
    //If the characters being compared do not match we return false; if they do match we increment `p1` and `p3` and repeat the
    //comparison until we run out of characters to compare. If it is `p1` that exceeds it's limit before `p3` we return falsse as
    //the prefix must be compelete; else we cotinue onto the next element in `words`. Once iterating through all elements in `words`
    //we check that all characters in `s` where checked, return true is so or false if not.
