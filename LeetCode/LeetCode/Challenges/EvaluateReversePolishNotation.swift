struct EvaluateReversePolishNotation {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is number of tokens
    //Space: O(n) where n is number of tokens
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a stack we add elements until we come to an operator, at which point we pop two elements from the stack
    //and apply the operator to them. The result of this calculation is then added to the stack so that it can be
    //used next iteration.
    //
    //N.B. It's important to note that order of the elements retrieved from the stack is essential for getting the
    //correct answer for division and subtraction calculations
    //
    //N.B2. You might be tempted to use a `result` variable so to only fill the stack with token elements rather
    //than it also contain the ongoing result - don't do this as trying to handle the special case which is the
    //first iteration (where you need to take two elements from the stack) and subsequent iterations (where you
    //only need to take one) leads to some very messy code for division and subtraction
