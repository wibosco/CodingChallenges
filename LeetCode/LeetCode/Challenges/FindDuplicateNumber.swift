    //slow and fast pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Knowing that `nums` contains values that are less than its count (i.e. [1, n]) we can use those values as indexes. So by
    //treating `nums` as a linked list where the value of the current element is the `next` property, we can use fast and slow
    //pointers to detect a cycle with that linked list and from there determine which element is the duplicate by iterating
    //that cycle until they collide.

    //Solution Description:
    //As we know that `nums` goes from `[1, n]` without gaps we know that if we have [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] then 3 will have 2
    //elements that are less than it so if our array has duplicates then [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] then here 3 has 3 element
    //less than it so the duplicate must be less than 3. We can use this property and a twist on binary search to narrow
    //down our search space. Using binary search we select the mid element in our search space we then check how many
    //elements in `nums` is less than or equal to (in case we have selected the duplicate) `mid` (remember the range is
    //always [1, n]). If that count is greater than expected then we know that potentially we have duplicate and that further
    //searching only needs to happen to the left of `mid` and we move the right boundary left; if count is as expected less
    //than or equal to mid then we know that the duplicate must be to the right of mid and we move the left boundary right.
    static func findDuplicateBinarySearch(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {
        var left = 1

            let mid = left + (right - left) / 2
            
            var count = 0
            for n in nums where n <= mid { //Time: O(n)

            }
            
            if count > mid {//Note comparison happening against index here

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Knowing that `nums` contains values that are less than its count, we can use those values as indexes. So iterating
    //through `nums` we treat the value of each element as an index and then set that indexes value to be negative. If

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a set (for O(1) search time) to store `nums` elements that we have already seen, we loop through `nums` and check
    //if that element is already in `count`. If it is we have found our duplicate; if it is not then we add it to `count` and

    //Solution Description:

    //each element with it immediate neighbor. If they match we have found our duplicate; if they don't match we move onto the
