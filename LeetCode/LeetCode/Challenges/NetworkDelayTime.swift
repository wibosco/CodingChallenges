    //Solution Description:
    //Using Dijkstra's algorithm we calculate the cheapest/shortest path from `k` to all connected nodes. Dijkstra algorithm is
    //greedy in nature - it always chooses the smallest/cheapest path to traverse. In order to build the graph we first convert
    //the edges (`times`) to an adjacency list. Then starting at `k` we add all neighbors to a priority queue and calculate the
    //distance it would take to travel between between these nodes (taking into account any distance already travelled). We
    //store this distance in the `distances` dictionary with the node to be travelled to (`neighbor`) as the key and the
    //distance as the value - it's important to note again, that the distance is the total distance to travel to that node not
    //just the immediate distance between the two nodes (`node` and `neighbor`). If that `neighbor` node has already been
    //reached via a different path then we check if the current path is smaller/cheaper than the existing path and only if it
    //is do we update `distances` with the current paths distances (all paths start out as infinite distance i.e `distances`
    //does not contain the key) - a process known as relaxation. If neighbor hasn't already been visited we add it to
    //`priorityQueue`. Once all neighbors have been checked we re-sort the queue so that the smallest/cheapest next node to
    //travel to is at the end. After traversing the graph, we iterate through each node in the graph and add the time taken
    //to get to that node to `totalTime` - if we encounter `Int.max` as a value then we treat that as there being no path
    //between `k` and that node and so immediately return `-1`. Once we have summed all times, we return `totalTime`.
    //
    //N.B. I've omitted using a MinHeap as this isn't a data structure included with standard Swift and won't be feasible to
    //code it in a coding challenge.
