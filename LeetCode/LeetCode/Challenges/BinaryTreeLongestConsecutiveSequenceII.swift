    //binary tree
    //DFS
    //recursive

    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS we traverse to the leaf nodes and gradually build up our path values as the recursive stack unwinds. In order
    //for two nodes to form a consecutive sequence they need to have an absolute difference of 1 - so either the order of the
    //nodes can be either ascending or descending. To avoid having to continuously work out if our path is ascending or
    //descending at each possible candidate node we return two values - the ascending count and the descending count. One of
    //both of these values will be zero. We compare the current node with it's immediate child nodes to determine if either
    //can be used to form a sequence, if they can we update the relevent ascending or descending count by adding 1 (being the
    //current node) to it. As we potentally have two child nodes and both can fulfil the ascending or descending criteria we
    //choose the larger of the two paths for both ascending and descending to pass further up the stack. Note that the path
    //don't need to come from the same child node. There is a special case where the current node can join the two paths into
    //either into a sequence - here we add `ascending` and `descending` and 1 together - note this combined value can not be
    //passed up as we want a path not a subtree. We repeat this process until we are back the root.
