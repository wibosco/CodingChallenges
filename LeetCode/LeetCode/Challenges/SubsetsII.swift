struct SubsetsII {
    
    //Time: O(2^n * n log n) where n is the number of nodes in `nums`
    //Space: O(k + m * m) where k is the number of subsets
    //                    where m is the number of levels in our tree

    //Solution Description:
    //To generate every possible subset we need to be always moving "forward" with `nums` and adding each array that we
    //build to `subsets` (note that unlike combinations or permutations we don't wait to reach "x" before adding the
    //current to `subset`, we add any length of `current` to subsets). We first sort `nums` so that all duplicate values
    //are beside each other - this will us to efficiently compare elements in `nums` to find duplicates. We use
    //backtracking to ensure that all possible combinations are generated and to ensure we are always moving forward we
    //track the starting index of the previous iteration and ensure that we only use elements to the right of that index.
    //To avoid having duplicate `subset` arrays but still using all elements, each iteration we check if the current
    //element is the same as the previous element and if so we skip searching down that branch as this combination will
    //still generated through the DFS call on another branch.
    //

                //(hence the first conditon of `i > startingIndex`) so for [2, 2, 2, 5] curr will eventually be `[2, 2, 2]`
