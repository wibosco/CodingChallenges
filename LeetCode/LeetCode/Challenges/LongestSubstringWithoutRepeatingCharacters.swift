    //Space: O(n) where n is the characters in `s`
    //string
    //sliding window
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a dictionary `map` to store the characters we have already seen, we iterate through `s`. As we iterate through we keep
    //track of the start of our non-repeating subarray - `currentStartIndex`. For each character we encounter we check if we have
    //already seen the current character in the current on-repeating subarray i.e. from `currentStartIndex...i`. If we have seen
    //that character we set the `currentStartIndex` to be the index after that previous version of the the current character (it
    //must the index after so as to exclude the repeat). We then calculate the length of the current non-repeating characters and
    //compare it with our all time longest. If it's longer we replace it.
    //
    //N.B. This solution is sufficiently quicker when using a Character array rather than a string index
