    //Solution Description:
    //Using a dictionary `map` to store the characters we have already seen, we iterate through `s`. As we iterate through we keep
    //track of the start of our non-repeating subarray - `left`. For each character we encounter we check if we have already seen
    //the current character in the current on-repeating subarray i.e. from `left...right`. If we have seen that character we set
    //the `left` to be the index after that previous version of the the current character (it must the index after so as to exclude
    //the repeat). We then calculate the length of the current non-repeating characters and compare it with our all time longest.
    //If it's longer we replace it. Once all characters have been checked we return `longest`.
    //
    //N.B. There is no need to "cleanup" `map` as we can just exclude those entries in `map` that fall outside of the window.
