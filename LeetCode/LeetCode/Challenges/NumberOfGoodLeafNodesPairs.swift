struct NumberOfGoodLeafNodesPairs {
    
    //Time: O(n * l^2) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
    //                 where l is the number of leaf nodes
    //Space: O(h + l) where h is the height of the tree

    //Solution Description:
    //In order to find the shortest distance between two leaf nodes we need to find the lowest common ancestor between those nodes. We
    //can use a bottom-up DFS to traverse the leaf nodes in the tree and then as the callstack unwinds, leaf nodes will both unwind at
    //the same time to the same ancestor node allow us to calculate the distance between them. To avoid having to re-traverse from that
    //ancestor node we can have each leaf node return the depth it is at, we can then combine these depths to get the distance between
    //them and compare that difference to `distance` to determine if those nodes are "good". After we compare all leaf nodes we combine
    //the two depth arrays to pass further up the callstack - this way we don't double count leaf nodes.
