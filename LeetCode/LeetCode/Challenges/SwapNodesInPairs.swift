    //linked list
    //iterative
    //sentinel head
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through the list, in order to swap to adjunct nodes we need to keep track of two nodes: `n - 1` and
    //`n`. First we attach `n + 1` as the next node of `n - 1`, then we set the next property on node `n` to
    //point to `n + 2`, then we set the next property of node `n + 1` to point to node `n`. All that left to do is
    //move the the `current` and `previous` node pointers so `previous` is now node `n` and `current` is node
    //`n + 2`. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the list, we can then return the `next` node of
    //our dummy/sentinel holding node.

            next.next = current
            
            previous = current

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through the list, swapping the `head` with the `next` node so that `next` -> `head` and then recursively call
    //swap on the next two nodes. At the end we return the `next` node which is now the `head` node of the pair, the
    //returned `node` is then used as the next node of the old `head` so that all nodes are joined to another node (apart
    //from the end node)
