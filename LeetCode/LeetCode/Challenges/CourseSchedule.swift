    //Solution Description:
    //Treating `numCourses` as the vertices in a graph and each `prerequisites` element as an edge between two vertices we
    //first build a adjacency list to allow for easy access to each vertice and use that adjacency list to detect the presence
    //of a cycle or not. A course prerequisite is by it's very nature a a direct edge so a valid prerequisites needs to be
    //acyclic which means that in order for the `prerequisites` to be valid we need to determine if `adjList` contains a DAG.
    //Using DFS topological sort (without the sorting) we can iterate over all vertices in the graph (there is no guarantee
    //that all vertices are connected) and look for any cycles. In order to detect a cycle we need to track which vertices are
    //currently on the call stack of this DFS, if we encounter the same vertice twice then the graph has a cycle (in a DAG we
    //should be able to search all the descendants of a vertice before we can encounter it again). Note, that the call stack
    //will not contain all vertices that this DFS has seen, only those that have descendents still be processed - a vertice
    //being visited multiple times doesn't necessarily mean there is a cycle, it is only a cycle if that vertice is being
    //re-visited by one of it's own descendents (hasn't got to be a direct descendent). As there is no quick way to search the
    //actual callstack for a given node we use `callStack` as a stand-in. Being a set, `callstack `allows us to query if a
    //vertice is repeated in O(1) time. Once we have traversed all vertices from a source we remove it from `callstack` as any
    //further encounter with that vertice shouldn't be treated as the sign of a cycle. When all possible source vertices has
    //been traversed we can return `cycleDetected`. To avoid re-searching the same graph from a different starting vertice we
    //use `visited` to hold those vertices already visited.
