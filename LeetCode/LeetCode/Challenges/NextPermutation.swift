struct NextPermutation {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums`
    //Space: O(1)
    //array
    //two pointers
    //inline
    //permutation
    //pivot & swap
    //backtracking (virutal not actual)
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //To find the next permutation we need to find an element that when swapped with another minimally increases `nums` in
    //value. The element that minimally increases `n` in value is the left-most element that when reading from right to
    //left is smaller than it's right neighbor i.e. the elements to it's right are in ascending order (right to left) and
    //this element breaks that order e.g.
    //
    //In `834762` the `4` is that value
    //
    //We call this breaking order element the `pivot`. This `pivot` is what we want to change because a descending subarray
    //to the right shows that all permutations with the `pivot` as the root have been exhausted and that the root of this
    //tree now needs to be changed for it's next element which must exist to the right as there are larger values there.
    //Remember that when performing a DFS there is an order to how you choose the next element - this order is the same for
    //every permutation. Think of it like backtracking, once all possible subtrees have been built we move the root onto the
    //next element (which is the smallest value in the search space to the right) as in DFS we would be looping over the
    //neighbors. Once we have the `pivot` we need to find the smallest value that is greater than it to swap over - this is
    //to minimise the increase in `n`. You might be thinking if everything to the right of `pivot` is ascending won't that
    //smallest value be the last digit in `n` - be careful here, just because the `pivot` is smaller than it's neighor
    //doesn't mean that it is smaller than all elements to the right and swapping the `pivot` with an element smaller than
    //itself would not result in the smallest permutation of `n` greater than `n` but rather a smaller permutation of `n`
    //e.g.
    //
    //In `834762` we don't want to swap the `4` with the `2` as `832764` < `834762` instead we want to swap it with the `6`
    //
    //So having swapped the `pivot` with the smallest right neighbor that is still greater than the `pivot` e.g.
    //
    //`836742`
    //
    //we can still make this number smaller by reversing those ascending numbers to the right of the old `pivot` index to
    //descending order e.g.
    //
    //`836247`
