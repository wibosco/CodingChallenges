    //Solution Description:
    //Using BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) we know that division and multiplication
    //should be processed before addition and subtraction. In order to process `s` correctly we need to "park" any addition and
    //subtraction operations until after all division and multiplication operations are complete. We can use a stack to hold the
    //values and a variable to know the last operation seen. As we iterate through `s` we check if the current character of that
    //iteration is a number or a symbol. If we encounter a number we fast forward through characters that make up that number,
    //once the full number has been found we check what the current operation is. If the current operation is a "+" or "-" we
    //store the number in `stack` (with the subtraction operation value being stored a negative as adding a negative is the same
    //as directly subtracting - we will see this later); if the current operation is a "*" or "/" we process those straight away
    //by popping the last value from the stack - the result of that operation is then stored in the `stack` to be used later. If
    //the current iteration is a symbol we update `symbol`. Once all characters in `s` have been processed we are left with the
    //addition and substraction operations to be performed which we can do by iterating through the stack and adding ever found
    //to `total`, `total` is then returned as the result.

    //subtraction operations until after all division and multiplication operations are complete. We can use a stack for this.
    //First we iterate through `s` converting the string values into int values. If we encounter a "+" or "-" we store those

    //last value from the stack - the result of that operation is then stored in the `stack` to be used later. As we only process
    //the stack when an operation symbol is encountered special care must be taken for the last value of `s` to ensure it is
    //processed - we do this by checking if `i` equals the count of `s` and processing the `currentValue` right there and then.
    //Once we have processed all division and multiplication operations we then iterate through all the elements in the stack and
    //add them together giving us the final result.
    //
    //NB. We are processing the operation after we "parse" the second value in the operation by processing the operation symbol
    //after we encounter the next one (or the end of `s`).
