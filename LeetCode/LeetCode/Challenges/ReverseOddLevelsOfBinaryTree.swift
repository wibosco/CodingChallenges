struct ReverseOddLevelsOfBinaryTree {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(m) where m is the number of nodes in the widest level of the tree
    //binary tree
    //BFS
    //iterative
    //level traversal
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using BFS we traverse the tree level-by-level. At each level we check if that level is odd, if it is we swap the current node's
    //value with its mirrored node's value - note how we don't swap the actual nodes just their values, this saves us having to
    //re-associate any child nodes. We repeat this process for all nodes in the tree.
