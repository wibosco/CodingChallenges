    //We can use a twist on binary search to search through `nums` and find the peaks. Rather than comparing the `mid` element
    //against a target, we instead compare it against it's right neighbor and attempt to identify a trend in the data i.e. up,

    //right neighbour is lower (we don't just return as while `mid` is greater, it itself might be part of a downward slope),
    //move right if the right neighbour is equal or greater than. Eventually we narrow down on an actual peak and can return
    //it as the `left` index.
