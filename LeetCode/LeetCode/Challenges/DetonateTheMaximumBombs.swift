    //Solution Description:
    //If we treat the bombs as nodes on a graph, we can treat the blast radius of each bomb as a potential weight edge between
    //those nodes. Determing where the blast radius reaches isn't as simple as comparing `x` and `y` as the blast radius is a
    //circle instead we need to use `distance = √((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)` to determine how fall apart two bombs are. So
    //using that forumla we can build an adjacency list of graph - if a bomb falls inside the blast radius of a another bomb
    //they are connected, this relationship needs to be check both ways as different bombs have different blast radius i.e. our
    //graph is a directed graph. While we can think of our graph as a weighted graph once we have our edges in place we don't
    //need to care about the weighting of the edge so can drop that detail. Once we have our adjacency list we perform a DFS
    //from each node and track the nodes visited during that search. We then compare the nodes visited from each node and keep
    //track of the largest which is returned once all DFSs are complete.
