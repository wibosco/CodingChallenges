    //Solution Description:
    //We traverse the tree in a DFS manner, at each level we compare the delta of that levels node value with the `target`.
    //If that delta is less than `closet` then that nodes delta becomes the closet. As this is BST we then choose which
    //node to traverse next (left or right) based on how it compares to the target - target larger go right, target
    //smaller go left. We repeat this process until we hit a leaf node and the recursive stack unwinds. We can then return
    //the closet value.
