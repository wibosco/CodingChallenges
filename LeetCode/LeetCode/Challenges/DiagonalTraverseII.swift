    //Solution Description:
    //Cells that are on the same diagonal have the same value when you sum their row and column values. We can use this property
    //to group the cells that we encounter in one pass. Once all cells are grouped we then iterate through each group, starting
    //0 and add each diagonal array to `order`. We can then return `order`.

    //Solution Description:
    //The starting cell for every matrix is either the first column or the bottom row, making an `L` shape. Some rows don't have
    //all there columns, so first we determine which row has the maximum columns so that we can traverse through the full search
    //space even if that cell doesn't exist. First we find all diagonals starting from the first column and storing each cell we
    //encounter in `order`. With each diagonal we gradually move upwards and rightwards until we run out of rows or columns.
    //Next we perform the same movement but this time starting with the cells on the bottom row. Once all diagonals have been
    //traversed we return `orders`
