struct UniqueBinarySearchTrees {
    
    //Time: O(n^2) where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(n)
    //sorted
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterating through all possible roots (0..n) we split the tree around each root with everything left of the root being
    //the left branch and everything right of the root being the right branch. We then combine all those possible left and
    //right branches to form one whole tree with the root being `i` in `count`.
