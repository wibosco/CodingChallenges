struct ConvertBinarySearchTreeToSortedDoublyLinkedList {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree

    //sentinel head
    //sorting
    //linked list
    //doubly linked list
    //in-line
    //inout
    //in-order
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Performing an in-order traversal we pass the sentinel node to the bottom of the left tree as the tail of the linked list
    //Once we reach the end we associate that left most node with the linked lists tail node (sentinel) by updating the
    //left-most node's left value to point at the tail node and the tails right value to the node. We then update the tail to
    //be the node we just processed and traversal the right tree. We repeat this process until all the nodes have been
    //processed, at which point we take the right value of the sentinel and return it as the head of the linked list.
    //
    //N.B. How `tail` is an inout parameter as this allows it to "travel" across different levels of the tree as the
    //recursive stack unwinds.

    //Solution Description:
    //We perform an in-order traversal pf the tree, adding each node encounter to the `order` array. We then iterate through
    //the nodes and reconnect their `left` and `right` properties based on the order of the nodes in the `order` array. Once
    //all nodes have be reconnected we then connect the first and last nodes together and return that first node.
