struct ConvertBinarySearchTreeToSortedDoublyLinkedList {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree

    //Solution Description:
    //Performing an inorder traversal we pass the fake-head node to the bottom of the left tree as the tail of the linked
    //list. Once we reach the end we associate that left most node with the linked lists tail node (fake head) by updating
    //the left-most node's left value to point at the tail node and the tails right value to the node. We then update the
    //tail to be the node we just processed and traversal the right tree. We repeat this process until all the nodes have
    //been processed, at which point we take the right value of the fake-head and return it as the head of the linked list
