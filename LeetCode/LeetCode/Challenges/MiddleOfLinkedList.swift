    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the list

    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a slow and fast pointer we iterate through the list. The slow pointer moves one node at a time whereas the fast
    //pointer moves two nodes. This result in the slow pointer pointing at the middle of the list

    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through the array, placing all nodes into an array in the order we encounter them in. Once list has been
    //fully traversed we divide the length of the array by 2 (as this is an int division any reminder is lost) and
    //return the element at that index
