struct LinkedListCycleII {
    
    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the list
    //Space: O(1)
    //two pointers
    //slow and fast pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a fast and slow pointer iterate through the list. If they meet we know that we have a cycle; if they don't meet
    //and the fast pointer reaches the end of the list then we don't have a cycle. If they do meet then we reset the slow
    //pointer back to the start of the list, this will ensure that the slow and fast pointer are both the same number of
    //nodes away from the entrance to the cycle. We then move each node by one node until they meet again, at which point we
    //can return either.

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through the list, inserting each unique node that we come across into the `list` set. If the set already
    //contains the node then we have a cycle and can return that node as the start; if we get to the end of the list we
    //know that the list doesn't contain a cycle and can return nil
