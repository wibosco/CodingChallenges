    //Space: O(1)
    //relative indexing
    //matrix
    //iterative
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using relative indexing we can compare the current matrix location [r, c] against it's top-left neighbor [r - 1,  c - 1],
    //if these don't have the same value then we don't have a toeplitz matrix. As the first row and column don't a top-left
    //neighbour we skip these. Finally if we have checked all values in the martix then it means that we do have a toeplitz
    //matrix and we can return true
    //
    //N.B. this solution would also work testing bottom-right neighbor, we would just need to skip the last row and column
    //instead

    //Solution Description:
    //If two elements are on the same diagonal then (r1 - c1) == (r2 - c2) we can use this to store the value for [r1, c1] and
    //compare against the value for [r2, c2] if they don't match then we know that don't have a toeplitz matrix, if they do
    //match then we check the next value, etc. Finally if we have checked all values in the martix then it means that we do have
    //a toeplitz matrix and we can return true
