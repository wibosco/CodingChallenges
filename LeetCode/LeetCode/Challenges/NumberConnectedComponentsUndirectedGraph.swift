//Solution Description:
//1. Each vertice is given an initial value of -1 to indicate that they are their own root
//2. Perform a union between two vertices by finding the root of each vertice (this will be a negative number). This root may not
//   be directly associated with the vertice but instead require multiple steps hence the while loop in `find`
//3. Compare the size of the nodes associated with each vertices root and select the root with the most nodes i.e. lowest negative
//   value. Update the smaller root to point at the other root and update the other roots count to include the count that the
//   former root had
