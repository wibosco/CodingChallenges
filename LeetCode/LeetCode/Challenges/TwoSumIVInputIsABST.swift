    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(n)
    //binary tree
    //binary search tree
    //DFS
    //recursive
    //inout
    //set
    //inverted thinking
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS and a visited set we traverse the tree and at each node attempt to see if we have already seen the delta of 
    //that current nodes value and `k` by checking if that delta value is in `visited`. If the delta is in `visited`, we
    //immediately return true,; if delta isn't in `visited` we add the current nodes value to `visited` and continue the
    //search. Particular care must be taken where the current nodes value and delta are the same as we can't reuse a node.
    //As `visited` is an inout set, values found in one branch of the search are available to other branches.

        guard !visited.contains(delta) else {
            return true
        }
        //insert needs to come after check to cover the case where delta == node.val
        visited.insert(node.val)
        
        return dfs(node.left, target, &visited) || dfs(node.right, target, &visited)
