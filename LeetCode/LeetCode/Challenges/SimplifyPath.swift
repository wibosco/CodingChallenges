    //Split path using "/" into directory-names and/or commands (`..`). Build stack of path by traversing through the split
    //path and apply thr rules:
    //
    //1. If current component is an empty string then skip it
    //2. If element is `.` - treat as a no-op and skip
    //3. If current component is '..', pop last component from the `stack`
    //4. Anything else add to `stack`

    //Solution Description:
    //Using a stack we build up the final version of the path by iterating through the characters in `path`. Treating the "/"
    //character as a signal the start of a new path component we fast forward through any additional "/" and then build up
    //the body of path component until we hit another "/" character which signals the end of that component. We then
    //determine if the path component is a command by checking if it is:
    //
    //1. `.` - treat as a no-op and skip
    //2.  '..', pop last component from the `stack`
    //
    //Anything else we add to `stack`. Once all chracters in `path` have been processed we concatenate the elements of `stack`
    //together, add a "/" prefix and return that single string.
