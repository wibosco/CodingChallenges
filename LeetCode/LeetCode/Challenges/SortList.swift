struct SortList {
    
    //Time: O(n log n) where `n` is the number of ndoes in the list
    //Space: O(1)
    //sorted
    //recursion
    //three pointers
    //fast and slow pointers
    //merge sort
    //divide and conquer
    //sentinel head
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //We can use merge sort to sort this linked list. First we need to find the middle node in the linked list which we can
    //do using a fast and slow pointer approach (the fast pointer moves at double speed compared to the slow pointer), having
    //found that middle node we then split the list around it by removing it as the next node to the node at `middle - 1`.
    //With these two lists we then attempt to recursively sort them. If the list only has one node then return it as we can't
    //get a smaller list than 1; else we split the smaller list around its middle node. After splitting/dividing we should have
    //two lists at each recursive level which then compare against each other and move each node into its sorted position. As we
    //sort the lists at each recursive level we eventually sort the full list and can return it
    //
