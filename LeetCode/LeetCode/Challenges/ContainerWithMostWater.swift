    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Treating the size of each element in `height` as the vertical edge (height) of a rectangle and the distance between two
    //elements as the horizontal edge (width) we can calculate the area of water each configuration can contains. Using two
    //pointers we move through the array and calculate the area at between the two pointers - we choose the smaller of the two
    //heights to use in the area calculation. This area is then compared against the largest area we have seen so far and if
    //larger it replaces it, else we move on. When deciding which pointer to move for the next area calculation we do so in a
    //greedy manner by only moving the smaller pointer.
