    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of elements in `logs`

    //stack
    //array

    //Solution Description:
    //A functions execution can be split by multiple functions inbetween so calculating the execution time isn't as simple as
    //substracting the start time from the end time as those unbetween functions effectively "pause" the current function.
    //Using a stack we can store the start logs in the order they appear. Once we encounter an end log we pop the top log from
    //`stack` (this will be in the starting log of the end log) as calculate the difference between the two timestamps before
    //adding to the value in `times`. It's important to note that the value in `time` might not be 0 because as we the process
    //the current end log we also adjust the time value of the wrapping function to remove the time that the wrapped function
    //was "paused". Once all logs have been processed we return `times`.

            let type = components[1]
            let timestamp = Int(components[2])!

            if type == "start" {
                stack.append((fid, timestamp))
            } else {
                //last element in `stack` is should be the start log of the current log

    //Solution Description:
    //In order to calculate how long a process has been running we to stitch together all the times that process has had sole
    //use of the CPU. There are two scenarios where a process isn't running:
    //
    //1. It has been paused (because another process is now running)
    //2. It has been ended
    //
    //For both these scenarios we need to calculate the difference between the previous timestamp and current timestamp to
    //determine that run time. So we are effectively using the present/current process to determine the runtime of the previous
    //process. As a process can be paused and/or have multiple instances we can stitch it's running time together adding to a
    //running total associated with that process - `times`, with the process ID being the index. We can use a stack to hold any
    //running/paused processes. When a new process starts we peek at the previous process on the stack to update that previous
    //processes running time value. When a process ends we pop from the stack to and update that ended processes running time
    //value. Please note that every start has a end so we don't need to handle any cases around non-ended processes. Also the
    //start and end logs are balanced i.e. start and ends happen in sequence - could have `A-start, B-start, B-end, A-end` but
    //not `A-start, B-start, A-end, B-end` so if we get an end log then the top of the stack should be its corresponding start
    //log
    //
    //NB. Really important to spot that when a process ends it takes the full second to end so actually it ends on the next
    //second
