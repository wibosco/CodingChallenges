struct KthLargestElementInArray {
    
    //Time: O(n) `n` is the number of elements in `nums`
    //Space: O(n + log n) `n` is the number of elements in `nums` (log n for the recursive stack)
    //quickselect
    //quicksort
    //in-line
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using `quick select` we sort `nums` around a pivot by gradually partitioning `nums` into a smaller and smaller array.
    //As we are not aiming to fully sort `nums`, after each partiton (if we haven't sorted `k` into its final position) we
    //only need to further sort that partition that contains the `k` index. As quick sort will sort in ascending order to
    //find the largest Kth element we need to invert `k` by counting `k` elements from the end to return the correct value.
    //
    //N.B. Here we are using Lomutos partitioning scheme, see:
