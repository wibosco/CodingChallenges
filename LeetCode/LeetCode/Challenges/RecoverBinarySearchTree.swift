struct RecoverBinarySearchTree {

    //binary tree
    //binary search tree
    //array
    //DFS
    //in-order
    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Performing an inorder traversal of a binary search tree should result in an array of ordered/sorted nodes. We can use
    //this property to find which nodes are out-of-order in our tree and switch them. A node is out-of-order if it breaks
    //the ascending order so first we search for a node that is greater then the node that comes after it. Then we look for
    //another node that is out-of-order that comes after `p1`. To avoid potentally having both pointers at the same index,
    //the second search at the far end of the ordered array and works it's way towards `p1`. When we find both nodes,
    //instead of having to actually switch the nodes which would involve breaking their existing left and right connections
    //we can instead merely change the `val` of each node to the opposite nodes `val`.
    //
    //IMPORTANT NOTE: carefully read any data structure you are given as the `TreeNode` had it's `val` property as `var` -
    //hinting at updating `val` value rather than truly swapping the nodes (connections and all)

    //Solution Description:
    //Performing an inorder traversal of a binary search tree should result in an array of ordered/sorted nodes. We can use
    //this property to find which nodes are out-of-order in our tree and switch them. There are two possible scenarios for
    //out-of-order nodes:
    //
    //1. Adjacent nodes
    //2. Distant nodes
    //
    //To handle both these scenarios we set both the first and second nodes to be `i` and `i + 1` the first time we encounter
    //an out-of-order node. We then continue searching to see if the array has another out-of-order node. If it does we know
    //that the originally set second node isn't right and we instead set to this new out-of-order node i.e. we are in the
    //distant node scenario; if it doesn't then we are in the adjacent node scenario. Instead of having to actually switch the
    //nodes which would involve breaking their existing left and right connections we can instead merely change the `val` of
    //each node to the opposite nodes `val`.
    //
