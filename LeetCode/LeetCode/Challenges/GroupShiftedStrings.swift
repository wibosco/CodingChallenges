struct GroupShiftedStrings {
    
    //Time: O(m) where m is the number of characters contains in all `stings` elements
    //Space: O(m)
    //string
    //dictionary
    //array
    //wrapping
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //For each string in `strings` we calculate the distance between each character in that string - we repeat until we
    //calculate the distance for each character in that string. We then use those distances as the key for the `groupings`
    //dictionary with the string as the value. If two strings have the same distance then it means that they have been
    //rotated the same number of times and so match - this matching string is added to the `grouping` dict under the same
    //key. At the end we extract all values as an array of strings and merged them to form the result.
