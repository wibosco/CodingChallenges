    //linked list
    //three pointers
    //trailing pointer
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using three pointers we can iterate through the linked list and find the nodes that should be swapped in one pass. The
    //`left` pointer will find the `k`th node in from the start, the `trailing` node will find the `k`th node in from the
    //end, and the `right` pointer will find the end of the list. Knowing that the second node to be swapped will be `k`
    //nodes from the end but not knowing how many nodes are in the list we can use a trailing/offset pointer that only starts
    //to move after we already seen `k` nodes - this will result in the `trailing` pointer being `k` nodes in from the end of
    //the list. We then exchange their `val` values - note that there is not need to actually move the node itself just the
    //value it represents.

    //Solution Description:
    //We iterate through the linked list twice. The first time to determine the size of the linked list and the second time
    //to capture the nodes that will be swapped using that count to help determine which node is the second/right node. We
    //then exchange their `val` values - note that there is not need to actually move the node itself just the value it
    //represents.

    //in swapping and exchange their `val` values - note that there is not need to actually move the node itself just the value it
