    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the list of greater between `l1` and `l2`
    //Space: O(n)
    //math
    //modulo
    //sentinel head
    //overflow
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Rather than treat each list as containing one number, adding it to the other lists number and then splitting the sum
    //of that addition into nodes in a new list - which could result in an overflow if either the original numbers contained
    //in the list are too large or the sum is too large. We instead treat the lists as what they are - a collection of
    //numbers and we add that collection together individually - being careful to ensure that any carry from those additions
    //is also applied. This removes the possibility of overflow occuring during the addition. We make use of a dummy node
    //`placeholderHead` to ensure that even as the new list progresses we never lose the head of that list.
