    //Time: O(n log n) where n is the number of logs
    //Space: O(n + l) where n is the number of nodes/vertices and l is the number of logs
    //disjoint set
    //
    //Solution Description
    //Using disjoint sets combine the logs together. Sort the logs so that as we merge
    //each log into sets when we get to one set we know that we have the earliest time
    //and can return. If we get to the end with getting to one set we know not everyone
    //are friends and so can return -1

//Can only be applied on undirected graphs
//
//Solution Description:
//1. Each vertice is given an initial value of -1 to indicate
//   that they are their own root
//2. Perform a union between two vertices by finding the root
//   of each vertice (this will be a negative number). This root
//   may not be directly associated with the vertice but instead
//   require multiple steps hence the while loop in `find`
//3. Compare the size of the nodes assoicated with each vertices
//   root and select the root with the most nodes i.e. lowest
//   negative value. Update the smaller root to point at the other
//   root and update the other roots count to include the count that
//   the former root had
