    //Solution Description:
    //As this is a DAG we know that the graph will not contain cycles, all nodes will be connected and that edges are one way.
    //In order to find the minimum nodes required to full traversal this graph we need to think not about searching algorithms
    //but rather about how travel between nodes works. In order for a node to be reachable from another node it needs to have
    //an in-degree value that is greater than 0 which means that that node can not be part of other minimum node set. Only
    //nodes with an in-degree of 0 can be part of our minimum node set as otherwise they would be unreachable. So first we
    //iterate through `edges` and store the in-degree value for each destination node that we encounter in `inDegreeCount`. We
    //then iterate through `inDegreeCount` and add any nodes with a count of 0 to `result`.
