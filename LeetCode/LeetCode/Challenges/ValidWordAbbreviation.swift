    //both pointers. Where the current value of `abbr` is a number, we first check that number isn't `0` (if it is we return
    //false) and then fast forward through `abbr` building up the number. When we have the full number we increment the `word`
    //pointer (`p1`) by that number. When we exhaust either/both `word` and `abbr` we check if both have been fully processed
    //and return true or false depending on the outcome.
