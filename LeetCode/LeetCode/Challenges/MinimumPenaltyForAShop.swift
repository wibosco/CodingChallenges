struct MinimumPenaltyForAShop {
    
    //Time: O(n) where is the number of elements in `customers`
    //Space: O(1)
    //string
    //array
    //prefix sum
    //postfix sum
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //First we iterate through all elements in cutomers and determine what the penalty would be if the never opened. This
    //value is a postfix sum and will allows us to avoid O(n^2) work when determing the penalty for closing at any time.
    //We then loop back through `customers` and either increment or decrement `penalityForClosing` as we close the shop
    //from that hour. We track the minimum penalty value found, alongside the index where that minimum was first found.
    //At the end of the second `customers` iteration we return the index for the minimum.
