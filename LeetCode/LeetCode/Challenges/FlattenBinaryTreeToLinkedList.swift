struct FlattenBinaryTreeToLinkedList {

    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes
    //Space: O(n) where n is the number of nodes
    //binary tree
    //linked list
    //array
    //DFS
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using DFS perform a preorder traversal of the tree adding the nodes that we come across to an array. After the array is
    //populated we iterate through, setting the current nodes right node to the next node in the array. We also remove any
    //existing left and right associations

            let next = ordering[(i + 1)]
            
            curr.left = nil
            curr.right = next
