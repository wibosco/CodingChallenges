    //Time: O(n * m) where n is number for row in `rooms`

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Treating the matrix as a graph we can use BFS to determine how far away a given cell is from it's nearest gate. Rather
    //than starting with each cell and working out the nearest gate we can instead go in reverse and start from each gate. To
    //do this we first need to find the gates by interating through every cell in `rooms` and adding those indexes with a
    //value of 0 to`gates`. We then iterate through `gates` and start a BFS from each index. As we are trying to find any
    //given cells nearest index each level iteration through the queue we increment `level` which is then used to mark the
    //cell. As it is possible for a multiple gates to be accessible to the same cell, we only mark a cell with level if that
    //level is a lower value than the correct cells value. If a cell has a value that is less than `level` we skip it i.e.
    //we don't add its neighbors to the queue. As we process the queue we use a 4-way relative mapping array to determine
    //which cells to add the queue next. We repeat this process for all reachable cells before moving on to the next gate.
    //Once all gates have acted as the source for a BFS we are completed.
    //
    //NB: No need for a visited set as `rooms` acts as that as it updated with each iteration.

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //This is a graph problem. First we determine where (if) the gates are in the grid. These gates are then used as the starting
    //elements in our BFS queue (multi-source BFS). As we process the queue we use a 4-way relative mapping array to determine
    //which nodes are neighbors to the current node. From those neighbors we are only interested in rooms - which we determine by
    //checking if they are of value greater than `0`. For every room discovered we check if it's count is greater than our path
    //count (it's possible this room is nearer another gate than the gate we came from). If it is greater we update it with our
    //path count and add it the queue; if not greater we skip it.
    //
    //NB: As this is a graph rather than a binary tree, the BFS contains 3 loops rather than 2. The extra loop is to work through
    //the neighbors of a nodes - don't confuse this with the actual level traversal loop which is the second loop.
    //
    //NB: No need for a visited set as `rooms` acts as that as it updated with each iteration.
