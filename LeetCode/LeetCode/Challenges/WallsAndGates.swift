    //Solution Description:
    //This is a graph problem. First we determine where (if) the gates are in the grid. These gates are then used as the starting
    //elements in our BFS queue (multi-source BFS). As we process the queue we use a 4-way relative mapping array to determine
    //which nodes are neighbors to the current node. From those neighbors we are only interested in rooms - which we determine by
    //checking if they are of value greater than `0`. For every room discovered we check if it's count is greater than our path
    //count (it's possible this room is nearer another gate than the gate we came from). If it is greater we update it with our
    //path count and add it the queue; if not greater we skip it.
    //
    //NB: As this is a graph rather than a binary tree, the BFS contains 3 loops rather than 2. The extra loop is to work through
    //the neighbors of a nodes - don't confuse this with the actual level traversal loop which is the second loop.
    //
    //NB: No need for a visited set as `rooms` acts as that as it updated with each iteration.
