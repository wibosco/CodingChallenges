struct MaximumCoinsHeroesCanCollect {
    
    //Time: O(n log n + m log n) where n is the number of elements in `monsters`
    //                           where m is the number of elements in `heroes`
    //Space: O(n)
    //array
    //binary search
    //prefixSum
    //sorting
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //So we are given 3 arrays, `heroes` is independent while `monsters` and `coins` are linked. An efficent way of knowing
    //how many monsters a hero can defeat would be be sorting `monster` and using binary search to find the right most index
    //of the monster with a lower or equal power value. 
    //
    //However if we sort `monsters` how we keep the link with the values in `coins`?
    //
    //We can combine `monsters` and `coins` into one array and then sort based on the values of monster elements. From here
    //we can then create a prefix-sum array of the cost of defeating monsters as being able to defeat one monster means our
    //hero can defeat all lesser monsters as well. With these two array (sorted-and-combined-monster-coin array and
    //prefix-sum array) we can use binary to find which monsters our hero can defeat and then use the prefix-sum array to
    //determine the cost. We use binary search for all the heros and return the collected coins array.
