    //Solution Description:
    //Determine if `n` can cleanly be divided by each ugly prime, if it can divide it until it can't; if it can't
    //move onto the next prime. Once all the primes have been processed, check if `n` has been reduced to 1

        for prime in primes {
            while n % prime == 0 { //check if n can be be reduced cleanly by the prime
                n /= prime
