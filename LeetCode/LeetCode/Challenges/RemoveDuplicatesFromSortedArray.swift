struct RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray {
    
    //Time: O(n)
    //Space: O(1)
    //sorted

    //Solution Description:
    //Using two pointers we orderride duplicates with the next non-duplicate value. As this array is sorted we know that an
    //duplicates will come directly after a value. By using two pointers we keep the `slow` pointer on the edge of our
    //non-duplicates array while the `fast` pointers skims over any duplicates. Once a non-duplicate is found we expand our
    //non-duplicates array space by 1 and move that non-duplicate into that space. So if we start with `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
    //usingg this approach we will end up with `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]` with the `slow` pointer stopping at 2 so our non-duplicate
    //array is `[1, 2, 3]`. This happens by:
    //
    //1. [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3] <--- `slow` and `fast` pointing at same value
    //2. [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3] <--- `slow` and `fast` pointing at different values so `left + 1` is set to value of `fast`
    //3. [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3] <--- `slow` and `fast` pointing at same value
    //4. [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3] <--- `slow` and `fast` pointing at different values so `left + 1` is set to value of `fast`
    //5. [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3] <--- `slow` and `fast` pointing at same value
    //
    //(Just 5 iterations as `fast` starts at 1)
    //
    //NB: It's important to stress here that we override values and don't swap them

                //in the duplicate squence

                //sometimes `slow` and `fast` will be the same but its faster to just always assign than to
