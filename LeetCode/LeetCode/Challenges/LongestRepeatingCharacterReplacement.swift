struct LongestRepeatingCharacterReplacement {
    
    //Time: O(n * m) where n is the number of elements in `s`
    //               where m is the maximum window size
    //Space: O(n)
    //string
    //sliding window
    //dictionary
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a sliding window we are able to iterate through all the elements in `s` and determine the longest repeating
    //character length. We do this by first determining the most frequent character in our current window and seeing if
    //the window size minus that most frequent character count is less than or equal to `k`. If it is less than or equal
    //to `k` then we know that this window can be made up of repeating characters and we compare it to the largest window
    //size we have found so far, replacing it if need be; if it is greater than `k` then we know that expanding the
    //window further will only result a "more wrong" window, so instead we shrink the window by moving `left` to the
    //right and reduce the frequency of the character at that location. To avoid double counting `right` is always
    //incremented.
    //
    //N.B. We never actually create the replacing string as we are only interested in the count so there is no need to
    //know exactly which characters will be replace,

        guard k < s.count else {
            return s.count
        }
        
        let chars = Array(s)

        var right = 0
        
        while right < chars.count {
            windowFrequency[chars[right], default: 0] += 1
            let windowMaxFrequencyCount = windowFrequency.max { a, b in a.value < b.value }?.value ?? 1

            } else {
                //current window has too many elements to be replaced so shrink it down
                windowFrequency[chars[left], default: 0] -= 1

    //string
    //array
    //set
    //nested loops
    //sliding window
    //fast forward
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //First we determine all the unqiue characters in `s` and store them in `unique`. We then iterate through these unique
    //characters and using a sliding window calculate the longest possible sequence of each character when making at most `k`
    //`k` changes for different characters. As we iterate through `s` we gradually expand the `right` pointer while keeping
    //`left` static until we encounter a character that doesn't match `c1`. If `k` is greater than 0 we "change" the
    //character to match and continue pusing `right` rightwards. If `k` is equal to 0 then we need to contract the window by
    //moving it to either an index beyond an already changed character or the same index as `right` (this happens if `k` was
    //always 0). We repeat this process for all characters in `s`. Each iteration we compare the current sequence length
    //against the longest found so far and replace it as needed. We then repeat this process for each unqiue character. Once
    //all unqiue characters have been checked we return `longest`.
