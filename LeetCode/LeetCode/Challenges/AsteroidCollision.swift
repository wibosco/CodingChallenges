    //Solution Description:
    //Iterate through `asteroids` and compare the current asteroid with it's predecessors which are stored in a stack. If those
    //asteroids are moving away from each other or moving in the same direction then the current asteroid can be added to the
    //stack as they will be collide; if they are moving towards each other then they will collidate and we need to determine the
    //outcome of that collision. If they are the same size then both will be destoried and so we can  remove the last asteroid from
    //the stack and discard it along with the current asteroid; if the current asteroid is larger then the stack asteroid is
    //discarded and the next asteroid on the stack is compared against the current asteroid (and the process repeats) if the
    //current asteroid is smaller then it is discarded. Once all asteroids have been processed, then the stack contains the
    //surviving asteroid and is returned.
