    //Time: O(n) where n is the depth of the tree

    //binary tree
    //recusive
    //DFS
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Think of this as a binary tree where we need to find the value of a leaf node.

    //Rather than build every level of that tree instead we need to only build the path from root to leaf. Using recursion we back
    //up the leaf, determing the `k` index for each level (i.e. the path) until we get to the root where we know that value will
    //always be 0. From root we begin to move back down the tree using the `k` index that we calculated for that level to know if
    //that index will hold a `0` or `1`. Using the parents value we know that its children will either be `0 1` or `1 0` i.e. a
    //parent of `0` will always produce children of `0 1` in that order so if the `k` index is odd then the children on our path
    //will always be `0` (remember we are indexing from 1) - the opposite approach is taken if the parent is `1` as it's childern
    //will be `1 0`. We repeat this process until eventually the recursive call stack is empty and the leaf nodes value has been
    //found
