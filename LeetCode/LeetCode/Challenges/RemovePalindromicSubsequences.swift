struct RemovePalindromicSubsequences {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of characters in `s`
    //Space: O(n)
    //string
    //array
    //two pointers
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //`s` can only contain two values: "a" and "b" and we can remove palindromic subsequences from `s`. So we can remove all the
    //"a" or "b" elements with one operation (each) as a any subsequence of the same characters will always be a palindrome. So
    //if `s` isn't already a palindrome we know that our maximum number of operations to remove all elements in a palindromic
    //manner will be 2. What's left is to determine if `s` is a palindrome which we can do using two pointers and working inwards
    //from the edges of `s`, comparing the elements of each pointer against each other until we either find a mismatch or we run
    //out of elements to compare. If `s` is a palindrome then only one deletion is required to delete all characters in `s`.
