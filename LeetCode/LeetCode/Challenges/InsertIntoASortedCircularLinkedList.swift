struct InsertIntoASortedCircularLinkedList {

    //Space: O(1)
    //linked list
    //two pointers

    //Solution Description:
    //Iterating through the list we attempt find the position that the new node (`insertVal`) should be inserted. Using two
    //pointers we move through the list comparing `insertVal` against both the current node (`current`) and the next node
    //(`next`) in the list. If `insertVal` is between those two nodes values then we insert the new node there. Special care
    //needs to be taken when we reach the "end" of the ascending values as it is possible for `insertVal` to actually be the
    //smallest or largest value in the list so it won't actually fall between any two nodes and should be added at the end
    //(or start). Another special case is where having iterated through the list we still haven't found a "spot" for the new
    //node - this can occur when the list contains duplicate node values, in this case we need to insert the new node before
    //the `head` node.
