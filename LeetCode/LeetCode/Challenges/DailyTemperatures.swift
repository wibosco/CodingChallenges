struct DailyTemperatures {
    
    //Time: O(n) where n is the number of temperatures (technically O(2n) because of the inner while - whats
    //important to note here is that `stack` will only ever hold a total of `n` elements)
    //Space: O(n) where n is the number of temperatures
    //stack
    //monotonic decreasing stack
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //As we loop through the temperatures we push onto the stack any temperature that is less than the temperature at the
    //top of our monotonic decreasing stack. This ensures that the stack will be in decreasing order. If the temperature
    //is greater than the "top" of the stack then we pop that stack and determine the difference (in days) between the two
    //temperatures and store this in the "wait" array. We repeat this until the current temperature is smaller than the
    //top of the stack or the stack is empty.

    //Time: O(n^2) where n is the number of temperatures

    //
    //Solution Description:
    //The outer loop, loops through each temperature in order with the inner loop lopping through the temperatures after
    //the outer loop's temperature. A check is made to test if the inner temperature is greater than the outer. If so the
    //difference in days is added to the `wait` array and the inner loop breaks, if not the inner continues searching.
