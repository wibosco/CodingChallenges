    //
    //Solution Description:
    //As we iterate through `nums` we check if another `nums` element can be added to it to equal `target`. To avoid having to
    //nest loops we build a dictionary containing each seen `nums` element and its `index`. This will allow constant access time
    //to check for if the difference between the current `nums` element and target has already been seen. If that difference is
    //in `visited` we return the two indexes with the visited index being first (as it came before the current element)

        var visted = [Int: Int]() //[num: index]
