struct DiameterOfBinaryTree {
    
    //Time: O(n) `n` is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(1)
    //DFS
    //bottom-up
    //recursive
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Remembering that a tree is made up of smaller trees we use DFS to traverse to the end of each branch of those
    //trees. As the traversal calls returns we sum the left and right depth of that particular tree and compare it
    //against the deepest diameter that we currently have. Eventually we get back to the root where we stop.
    //
    //See: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/ for details on how to calculate the depth of
    //a tree
