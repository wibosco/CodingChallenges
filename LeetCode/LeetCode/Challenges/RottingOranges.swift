    //Solution Description:
    //This is a graph problem. First we determine where (if) the rotten oranges are in the grid and how many fresh oranges
    //we have. The rotten oranges are then used as the starting elements in our BFS queue. As we process the queue we use
    //4-way relative mapping array to determine which nodes are neighbors to the current node. From those neighbors we are
    //only interested in the fresh ones - which we determine by checking if they are of value `1` and also that we are not
    //in the `visited` array. The `visited` array contains the rotten nodes. For every fresh orange discovered we add it to
    //the `visited` array and reduce the `freshFruit' count. Each top level iteration of the loop is one level completed or
    //a "minute". Finally we check if all of the fresh oranges are rotten, if so we return the level count otherwise we
    //return -1.
    //
    //NB: As this is a graph rather than a binary tree, the BFS contains 3 loops rather than 2. The extra loop is to work
    //through the neighbors of a nodes - don't confuse this with the actual level traversal loop which is the second loop.
