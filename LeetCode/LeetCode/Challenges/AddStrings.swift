    //Solution Description:
    //To avoid overflow, rather than treating `num1` and `num2` as two single numbers instead we split them into digits and
    //calculate the sum by adding those digits together. As `num1` and `num2` can have different lengths when suming their
    //digits we need to start from the end of both to ensure that the digits being summed are of the same "weight". After
    //summing the value we extract the unit from the sum using integer division and add it to `result` and extract the `carry`
    //value from the sum using a modulo operation. With any addition, the sum might be greater than 9 so we need to need to
    //hold any `carry` value to use in the next iteration. While there are still values in either `num1` or `num2` to be added
    //or carry is greater than 0 we loop. If `num1` or `num2` is out of digits we default it's value to 0. The result of each
    //addition is then appended to the `total` array. Once all digits in `num1` and `num2` have been processed and carry is
    //equal to 0, we reverse the `total` array, converted it to a string and return it.
