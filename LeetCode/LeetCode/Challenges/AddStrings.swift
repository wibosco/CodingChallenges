struct AddStrings {
    
    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the greater of `num1` and `num2`
    //Space: O(n)
    //array
    //overflow
    //math
    //modulo
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Rather than treating `num1` and `num2` as two single numbers instead we split them into single units and add those units
    //together, being to hold on to add carry values that result from that addition. By treating as individual unit we avoid any
    //possibility of overflow as the number ranges are 0-9 for both numbers. The result of each addition is then add to the front
    //of our ongoing `result` string
    //
    //Similar to: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
