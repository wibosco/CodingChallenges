    //binary tree
    //binary search tree
    //pre-order
    //recursive
    //DFS
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //In order for a BST to be valid, all nodes on the right of a particular node need to be greater invalue and all nodes
    //on the left need to be lesser in value. So to validate a BST we can't just compare a root node with its left and
    //right nodes instead we need to also compare it with its predecessors value as well which we can do using a DFS. At
    //each iteration of the DFS we pass in the lower and bounds that the current nodes value must fit within in order to
    //be valid. If at any point the current nodes value is outside that bounds then we know this tree isn't a BST and can
    //return false else we return true for that particular node. We repeat this process for all nodes in the tree,
    //adjusting the `lower` and `upper` value depending on if we are going down the left or right child branch.

    //Solution Description:
    //A binary search tree has the property that all nodes to the left of root are less than root and all nodes to the right
    //of root are greater. This property means that an in-order traversal of a binary tree should result in an ascending
    //sorted array of that trees nodes if it is a binary search tree. So we perform an in-order traversal of this tree and
    //check if it's nodes are in ascending order by comparing to the node that is immediately before it. As the node that
    //is immediately before the current node in an in-order traversal might be "far" away from it we use an `inout`
    //parameter to hold that predecessor node. If the current node is less than or equal to it's predecessor then we know
    //that this tree is not a BST and can return false.
