    //Solution Description:
    //In order for a BST to be valid, all nodes on the right of a particular node need to be greater (not just it's
    //immediate right but the tree to its right) and all nodes on the left are less than (not just it's immediate left
    //but the tree to its left). So to validate a BST we can't just compare a root node with its left and right nodes
    //instead we need to also compare it with its predecessors value as well.

    //Solution Description:
    //A binary search tree follows the principle that nodes to the left of root are less and nodes to the right are greater.
    //This property means that an in-order traversal of a binary tree should result in an ascending sorted array of that
    //trees nodes if it is a binary search tree. So we perform an in-order traversal of this tree and check if it's nodes
    //are in ascending order
