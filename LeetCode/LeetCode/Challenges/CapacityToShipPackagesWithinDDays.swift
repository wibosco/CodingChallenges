    //largest/heaviest weight in `weights` and at a maximum be able to handle the sum of `weights`. We can treat this
    //min..max range as a sorted list of possible ship weights - now we just have to figure out the minimum ship weight in
    //this range will result in the `weights` being delivered in `days` days. Performing a binary search on this range we
    //can find that minimum weight while discarding half of the possible weights at each step. If the delivery takes greater
    //than the required days then we know we have chosen too small a weight for the ships i.e. the left edge needs to move
    //right; if the delivery can happen within the days using the current weight we need to ensure that that weight is the
    //minimum so we have to shrink the weight i.e. the right edge need to move left.
