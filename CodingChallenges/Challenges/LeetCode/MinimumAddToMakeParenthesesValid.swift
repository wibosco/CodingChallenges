struct MinimumAddToMakeParenthesesValid {
    
    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the number of characters in `s`
    //Space: O(n) where `n` is the number of characters in `s`
    //stack
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a stack, traverse `s` attempting to match brackets i.e. for "(" there must be a closing ")" later in the
    //`s`. Once we get the end of `s` any elements in the stack don't have a opening/closing bracket in the correct
    //squence so we would need to add that number of opening/closing brackets to balance the exisitng brackets.
