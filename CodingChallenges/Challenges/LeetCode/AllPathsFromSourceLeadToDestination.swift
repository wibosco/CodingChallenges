    //graph invalid) if we see that `visited` already contain the node we want to add. As we need

    //to be a leaf node (and can be the only leaf node) when we encounter a node that has no neighbors
    //we check if it is the `target` and act accordingly.
    //
    //N.B. As we only populate `adjList` with nodes that appear in the `edges` array (and even then only
    //source edges) our `adjList` will not be full. As such when traversing the graph any leaf nodes that
    //we encounter won't be in `adjList` so extra care must be taken here. When a leaf node is found we

    //"valid" - see problem description for details)
