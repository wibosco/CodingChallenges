    //Space: O(m)
    //dictionary
    //array
    //wrapping
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //For each value in `strings` we calculte the distance between each character in that value - we repeat until we calculate for each character in
    //that value. We then use that distance as the key for the `groupings` dictionary and the string as the value. If two strings have the same
    //distance then it means that they have been rotated the same number of times and so match - this matching string is added to the `grouping` dict
    //under the same key. At the end we extract all values as an array of strings and merged them to form the result
