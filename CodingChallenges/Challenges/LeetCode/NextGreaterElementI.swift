    //Time: O(n + m) where n is the numbers of elements in `nums1` and m is the number of elements in `nums2`
    //Space: O(n) where n is the the number of elements in `nums1`
    //monotonic decreasing stack
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a monotonic decreasing stack we iterate through `nums2` finding the next greater value
    //for element in that array - as `nums1` is a subset of `nums2` we know that the greater value
    //of any `nums2` element is also the greater value of any `nums1` element. As we find greater
    //values in `nums1` we pop the stack and add them to `nums2Dict` with the lesser value being
    //the key and greater value being the value. Once we are finished populating `nums2Dict` we
    //iterate through `nums1` and populate `result` with the values from `nums2Dict` in the order
    //of `nums1`
