struct ReconstructItinerary {

    //Time: O(d^e) where `d` is the maximum number of flights from an airport and `e` is the number of total flights
    //Space: O(n + e) where `n` is the number of airports and e` is the number of total flights
    //backtracking
    //dfs
    //greedy
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Convert the tickets in an adjacency list which we then sort. Sorting the list
    //allows us to choose the "smallest" route (greedy) between airports at all times so
    //ensuring that the first route is the expected route. We use backtracking to
    //explore possible routes until we find one that has a count of `tickets.count + 1`
