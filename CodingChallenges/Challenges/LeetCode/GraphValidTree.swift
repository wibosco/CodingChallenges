    //Solution Description:
    //1. A valid tree has one root (all nodes need to be connected) and no cycles
    //   by using a disjoint set we can test for both conditions. First a check is
    //   made to ensure that edges are not too few or too many and then a check is
    //   that connecting the nodes together does not result in a cycle

        //For the graph to be a valid tree, it must have exactly `n - 1` edges.
        //Any less, and it can't possibly be fully connected. Any more, and
        //it has to contain cycles.
