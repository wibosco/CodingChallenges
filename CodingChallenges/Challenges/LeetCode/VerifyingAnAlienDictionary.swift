    //Space: O(1) order always contains 26 characters
    //array
    //dictionary
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Store the `order` in a dictionary to allow constant look up time when comparing two letters. Take each word and compare it
    //with its right neighbor by comparng each letter against the letter at the same position of the neighbor. If the if left
    //neighbor is ever greater then this ordering is incorrect and we can return false. We contine this until we run out of
    //letters in one the words. If having reached the end of one of the words without finding a difference we compare the lengths
    //with the shorter word needing to come first
    //
    //N.B. Time complexity could also be described as O(m * n) where `m` is the length of `words` and `n` the characters per word
