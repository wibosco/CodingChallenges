struct EarliestMomentWhenEveryoneBecomeFriends {
    
    //Time: O(n log n) where n is the number of logs
    //Space: O(n + l) where n is the number of nodes/vertices and l is the number of logs
    //disjoint set
    //
    //Solution Description
    //Using disjoint sets combine the logs together. Sort the logs so that as we merge
    //each log into sets when we get to one set we know that we have the earliest time
    //and can return. If we get to the end with getting to one set we know not everyone
    //are friends and so can return -1
