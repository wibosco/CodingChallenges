    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the list of greater between `l1` and `l2`
    //Space: O(n)
    //math
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Rather than treat each list as containing one number, adding it to the other lists number and then splitting
    //the sum of that addition into nodes in a new list - which could result in an overflow if either the original
    //numbers contained in the list are too large or the sum is too large. We instead treat the lists as what they
    //are - a collection of numbers and we add that collection together individually - being careful to ensure that
    //any carry from those additions is also applied. This removes the possibility of overflow occuring during the
    //addition. We make use of a dummy node `placeholderHead` to ensure that even as the new list progresses we
    //never lose the head of that list.
    //
