struct FinalPricesWithSpecialDiscount {
    
    //Time: O(n) where `n` is the prices
    //Space: O(n) where `n` is the final prices
    //monotonic ascending stack
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using a monotonic ascending stack we iterate through the `prices` array, adding prices
    //to the stack until we come across an price that is less than the last price in the stock.
    //We pop that last item and pop substitute the current price from it to get the discounted
    //price which is then put into the `finalPrices` array.
