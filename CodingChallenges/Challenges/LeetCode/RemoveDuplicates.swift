//two pointers

struct RemoveDuplicates {
    //Don't use an extra memory structure
    //Time: O(n)
    //Space: O(1)
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Using two pointers we orderride duplicates with the next non-duplicate
    //value. This ensures that everything up to the `slow` index is in order
    //and contains no duplicates so so [1,1,2,2,3,3] becomes [1,2,3,2,3,3]
    //and slow pointer stops at index 2
    //
    //NB: The gap between the slow and fast pointer is a dead zone with values
    //that we don't care about. We only care about what comes before `slow` and
    //what comes after `fast`
    //
    //NB2: It's important to stress here that we override values and don't swap
    //them
