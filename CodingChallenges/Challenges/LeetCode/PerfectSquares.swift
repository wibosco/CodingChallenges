    //Solution Description:
    //First build a set with all possible squares up to `n`. Then using these squares perform
    //a BFS with the queue hold the running total of each branch - the square itself is seeded
    //with the squares. As we are only interested in the total and not the path, the queue can
    //be set so that if two branches have the same total they are effectively merged - this will
    //significantly speed up the BFS. The neighbor of each total is the `squares` set. If during
    //a level the total exceeds `n`, that branch is discarded.

        while !queue.isEmpty {
            //as we are iterating a set we can't add items to the end of the queue
            //as we build up the next level and  have them not interfere with the
            //current level. Instead each level needs its own queue to add to.
