    //Time: O(m*n) where `m` is the number of rows in grid and `n` is the number of columns

    //Solution Description:
    //Treat the grid as graph, potentally containing multiple unconnected subgraphs. Iterate through the graph
    //until we find land (cell containing `1`). Once we have found land we need to find all land that is
    //connected with it. Using BFS we traverse the graph from this land cell and find all connected land using
    //relative indexing. To ensure that we don't go back over already discovered land we keep track of it using
    //a `visited` set. Once we have exhasuatd all land connected to this first discovered land we increase the
    //island count and and try to find unexplored land by continuing to loop through the grid.
    //
    //N.B: This graph can have multiple unconnected subgraphs so we need to perform multiple BFSs
