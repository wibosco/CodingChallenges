//Union by rank
//see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU6udHRIkcc
//
//Can only be applied on undirected graphs
//
//Solution Description:
//1. Each vertice is given an initial value of -1 to indicate
//   that they are there own root
//2. Perform a union between two vertices by finding the root
//   of each vertice (this will be a negative number). This root
//   may not be directly associated with the vertice but instead
//   require multiple steps hence the while loop in `find`
//3. Compare the size of the nodes assoicated with each vertices
//   root and select the root with the most nodes i.e. lowest
//   negative value. Update the smaller root to point at the other
//   root and update the other roots count to include the count that
//   the former root had
