    //Time: O(n) where is the number of nodes in the tree
    //Space: O(n) where is the number of nodes in the tree
    //BFS
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //Traverse the tree using BFS, storing the nodes at each level in
    //an arry before adding them to a tree wide levels array.
    //
    //NB: As this is an N-ary tree rather than a binary tree, the BFS
    //contains 3 loops rather than 2. The extra loop is to work through
    //the neighbors of a nodes - don't confuse this with the actual level
    //traversal loop which is the second loop
