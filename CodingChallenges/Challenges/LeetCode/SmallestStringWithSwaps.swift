    //Time: O(n log n) where n is the number of pairs
    //Space: O(n) where n is the number of pairs
    //disjoint set
    //
    //Solution Description:
    //1. Using disjoint set build up a set of possible values for any of `s` indexes.
    //   This is needed because the swaps that can occur can interact with each other
    //2. Assign the actual character value to each of those groups
    //3, Sort each group to enusre that the smallest value character is first
    //4. Iterate through `s` changing the character at any given index for the smallest
    //   in the group (for that index)
