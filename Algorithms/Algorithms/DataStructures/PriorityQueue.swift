//A "normal" queue that operates on a FIFO basis where each element is considered equal and the ordering is determine solely on
//when an element was added to the queue. This is not the case with priority queues. In priority queues each element is
//prioritised against the other elements so that those elements with higher priority are removed first from the queue (note
//here that a higher priority doesn't mean a higher value - in a min priority queue those elements with a lower value are
//prioritised higher). Each time an element is added or removed the queue needs to be adjusted so ensure that the next element
//to be removed is the highest priority (note that we don't fully sort all the elements in the queue on adding or removing an
//element, instead we only sort enough so that highest priority element is next). There are two types of priority queue - min
//and max.

    private var heap: Heap<Element>

        heap = Heap(elements: elements, priorityFunction: priorityFunction)
