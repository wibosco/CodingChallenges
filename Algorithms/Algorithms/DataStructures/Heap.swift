//A heap (also known as a binary heap) is a complete binary tree (not s binary search tree) inside an array, so it does not use
//parent/child pointers. A heap is sorted based on the "heap property" that determines the order of the nodes in the tree. There
//are two kinds of heaps: a max-heap and a min-heap which are different by the order in which they store the tree nodes. In a
//max-heap, parent nodes have a greater value than each of their children. In a min-heap, every parent node has a smaller value
//than its child nodes. Just like in any binary tree, a heap can be split into mulitple subtrees where the relationship between
//parent and child nodes needs to the same e.g. parent is larger or equal to any child nodes - this relationship in a heap is
//called the "heap propery". A max-heap always stores the largest element at the root of the tree; a min-heap, always store the
//smallest item at the root of the tree. The root of the heap has the maximum or minimum element, but the sort order of other
//elements are not predictable. This partially sorted nature allows for insertions and removals to operate in O(log n) time
//rather than O(n) that would be required for a fully sorted array.
//
//N.B. Donâ€™t confuse these heaps with memory heaps - memory heaps are a different concept.
//
//N.B. Elements with an index > (heap.count / 2) are leaf nodes.
//
//N.B. A complete binary tree is one where all the levels of the binary tree are completely filled except (possibly) the last
//level, which is filled from left side.
