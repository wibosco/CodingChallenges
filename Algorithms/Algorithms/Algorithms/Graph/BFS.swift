    //Solution Description:
    //Breadth-first search involves searching a tree level by level - ensuring all node on a level have been searched before
    //moving onto the next level. A level is all immediate nodes connected to a node from the previous level e.g.

    //The levels of the above tree are:
    //
    //Level 1: 4
    //Level 2: 1, 6
    //Level 3: 0, 2, 5, 8
    //Level 4: 7, 9
    //
    //In this fashion it is possible to find the shortest path from the `source` to the `target` vertice by systemically
    //traversing the tree level by level. Starting with the `source` vertice we place all connected vertices into a queue
    //(FIFO). As we are searching this binary-search-tree at each level we choose whether to continue searching the left or
    //right branch by comparing the current nodes value against `target` - if `target` is less than the current node we continue
    //searching down the left branch only i.e. we put `node.left` into the queue; if `target` is greater than the current node we
    //continue searching down the right branch only i.e. we put `node.right` into the queue. After each level we increment the
    //`level` count as we moving further away from `source` - note it doesn't matter how many vertices a level contains we are
    //only interested in the number of levels as the measure of distance. If at any time we find `target` we return immediately.
    //If after searching all of the tree we haven't found `target` we return nil
    //
    //N.B. With a balanced BST by selecting only one branch to traverse we eliminate approx half of all remaining nodes to be
    //search giving this search a time of O(log n)
